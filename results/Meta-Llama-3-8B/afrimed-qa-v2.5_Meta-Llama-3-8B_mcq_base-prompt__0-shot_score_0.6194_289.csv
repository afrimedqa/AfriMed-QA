Explanation: Simple (nontoxic) goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by an inadequate supply of iodine. It is characterized by an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, often resulting in a visibly enlarged neck. Simple goiter is endemic in certain regions of Africa due to dietary iodine deficiency. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that results in inflammation of the thyroid gland. It is characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland, hypothyroidism, and the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies in the blood. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease that results in hyperthyroidism and an enlarged thyroid gland. It is characterized by the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies in the blood. Toxic multinodular goiter is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes enlarged due to the presence of multiple nodules, each of which produces excess thyroid hormone.

###Answer:","B

Rationale: Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms (schistosomes) that live in the blood vessels of the intestines or the bladder. Schistosomes are among the world's most widespread parasites. More than 200 million people are infected worldwide, and more than 90% of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is most common in rural areas and among poor people who lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Schistosomiasis can cause a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, and anemia. In severe cases, it can cause kidney failure, liver damage, and bladder cancer. Treatment is available, but many people in affected areas don't have access to it. There is no vaccine against schistosomiasis. The disease is transmitted through contact with contaminated water. The parasites live in freshwater snails, and people become infected when they come into contact with water that contains these snails. The parasites then penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the intestines or bladder. Once in these organs, they lay eggs that cause inflammation and damage. Symptoms usually don't appear until months or years after infection. They can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, and anemia. In severe cases, the disease can cause kidney failure, liver damage, and bladder cancer. Treatment is available, but many people in affected areas don't have access to it.",B,True,0.19999999599930804,0.04958677317225627,0.18823529011695514,0.8338648,0.85133505,0.8425094

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a condition characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the lining of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause of PUD is infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Other risk factors for PUD include smoking, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and stress. Symptoms of PUD include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Diagnosis of PUD is made through endoscopy and biopsy. Treatment of PUD involves a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medications. Prevention of PUD includes avoiding risk factors such as smoking and NSAID use.",B,True,0.34722221724633495,0.12182740626143439,0.31944443946855716,0.86084044,0.8683293,0.86456865

###Answer:","C.  Tuberculosis

Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease is transmitted by airborne droplets from infected individuals. In the United States, TB incidence has declined significantly since the 1950s. However, the incidence of TB in the United States has been increasing in recent years, particularly in the African-American population. TB is also prevalent in the developing world, especially in Africa and Asia. The disease is characterized by a chronic cough with sputum production, chest pain, weight loss, and fatigue. The disease is usually diagnosed by acid-fast staining of the sputum. The treatment of TB is a combination of drugs and requires a long course of therapy. The bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slow-growing organism that can survive for many years in the environment and is difficult to eradicate. The disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The treatment of TB is a combination of drugs and requires a long course of therapy.

B.  Onchocerciasis
C.  Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease)
D.  Lymphatic filariasis
E.  Loiasis

###Answer:","C.  Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease)

Rationale: 
Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) is caused by infection with the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis. The infection is transmitted through drinking water contaminated with copepods, small crustaceans that harbor the infective larvae of D. medinensis. The larvae penetrate the small intestine, migrate to the abdominal cavity, and then to the subcutaneous tissue of the lower extremities, where they mature into adult worms. The adult worms may remain dormant in the subcutaneous tissue for several years before they emerge through the skin. The female worm can grow up to a meter in length and is capable of producing up to 100,000 larvae. The larvae are released into the surrounding tissues, causing intense pain and swelling. The larvae can also migrate to other parts of the body, causing further damage. The disease is endemic to certain regions of Africa and is characterized by the presence of a palpable worm beneath the skin. Treatment involves the manual extraction of the worm, which can be a painful and time-consuming process. The disease can be prevented through the use of filtration systems to remove copepods from drinking water.

###Answer:","C

Explanation:  Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling mental illness characterized by impaired communication, disorganized speech, and disorganized behavior. Schizophrenia is also characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and catatonia. It is a complex mental disorder that is often accompanied by significant social and occupational dysfunction. Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness that affects about 1% of the population, with a lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%. The most common symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms (e.g., flat affect, alogia, and avolition). The symptoms of schizophrenia are divided into three main categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech. Negative symptoms include flat affect, alogia, and avolition. Cognitive symptoms include attention deficits, memory deficits, and executive function deficits. The symptoms of schizophrenia are typically present for at least six months and cause significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms of schizophrenia are typically treated with antipsychotic medications, which can be very effective in reducing symptoms. However, many people with schizophrenia also experience significant social and occupational dysfunction, which can be difficult to treat.",C,True,0.125874122640716,0.0,0.11188810865470203,0.7994878,0.84921306,0.8236006

Explanation: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer in Africa. The other options are not the most common type of breast cancer in Africa. IDC is a cancer that starts in the milk ducts and then spreads to other parts of the breast. It is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. IDC is often diagnosed at an early stage, when it is small and has not spread to other parts of the body. However, it can also be diagnosed at a later stage, when it has spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, and bones.

###Options:
A.  Topical antibiotics and dressings
B.  Oral antibiotics
C.  Surgical debridement and irrigation
D.  Limb amputation
E.  Conservative management with regular wound cleaning

###Answer:","C. Surgical debridement and irrigation
Rationale:
The wound is infected and it is likely that the patient has a deep-seated infection. A large infected wound may be the presenting symptom of a deep-seated infection, such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. Initial management should include surgical debridement and irrigation to remove any necrotic tissue and any foreign bodies. This will allow the wound to heal and will also help to identify the source of the infection. Once the wound is clean, antibiotics can be started. Oral antibiotics may be sufficient for some infections, but in this case, it is likely that intravenous antibiotics will be needed. Limb amputation should only be considered as a last resort if the infection is not responding to other treatments. Conservative management with regular wound cleaning may be sufficient for some superficial wounds, but it is not appropriate for a large, infected wound.

Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?
###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Avascular necrosis
D.  Septic arthritis
E.  Gout

###Answer:","E

Explanation: The clinical and radiographic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of gout. Gout is a metabolic disorder caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissues. The disease is most common in middle-aged men. The initial presentation is often acute and manifests as a red, swollen, and exquisitely painful joint. This is known as a gouty flare. The disease can progress to chronic tophaceous gout, characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in the form of tophi. Tophi are found in the subcutaneous tissues and may also involve the joints, tendons, and bursae. The diagnosis of gout is confirmed by the identification of urate crystals in the joint fluid or tophi. Treatment of gout includes the use of anti-inflammatory medications and allopurinol to lower serum uric acid levels. In severe cases, joint replacement surgery may be required.

###Answer:","C
Explanation:
Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. These abnormal hemoglobin molecules cause the red blood cells to assume a sickle shape, which can lead to blockages in blood vessels and damage to organs. The risk factors for sickle cell disease include:
* Family history of sickle cell disease: Individuals with a family history of sickle cell disease are at a higher risk of developing the disease themselves.
* Hemoglobin AS genotype: Individuals with the hemoglobin AS genotype (also known as the sickle cell trait) have one normal hemoglobin gene and one sickle cell gene. While they do not typically develop sickle cell disease, they are at a higher risk of complications if they contract certain infections or undergo certain medical procedures.
* Hemoglobin AC genotype: Individuals with the hemoglobin AC genotype have two abnormal hemoglobin genes, which can lead to more severe forms of sickle cell disease.
* Malaria: Individuals with sickle cell disease are at a higher risk of severe malaria, as the sickle-shaped red blood cells can become trapped in the small blood vessels in the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and other complications.
* Vitamin D deficiency: While vitamin D deficiency is not a risk factor for sickle cell disease, it can worsen the symptoms of the disease by contributing to anemia and bone pain.

###Answer:","C
Explanation:
This patient is suffering from a case of leprosy. Leprosy is caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae. The most common presentation of leprosy is a slowly progressive skin rash. The most common symptoms include numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. The patient may also have a loss of sensation in the affected area. The numbness and tingling are caused by the nerve damage that occurs as a result of the infection. The nerve damage can also lead to muscle weakness and loss of coordination. The diagnosis of leprosy is made based on the patient's symptoms and a physical examination. The diagnosis is confirmed with a skin biopsy. The treatment of leprosy consists of antibiotics. The antibiotics used to treat leprosy are the same antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis. The most common antibiotics used to treat leprosy are rifampin and dapsone. The antibiotics are usually taken for a period of 6-12 months. The goal of treatment is to cure the infection and prevent the spread of the disease. The patient should also be monitored for any signs of relapse. Relapse is a recurrence of the infection after the initial treatment. If relapse occurs, the patient will need to be treated with a longer course of antibiotics. The prognosis for leprosy is good if the infection is caught early and treated promptly. The prognosis is worse if the infection is not caught early or if the patient does not receive",C,True,0.20930232103839924,0.02857142445943937,0.20930232103839924,0.82561016,0.81553924,0.8205438

Rationale: 
The tuberculin skin test (TST) is the standard diagnostic test for latent TB infection in Africa. It involves injecting a small amount of purified protein derivative (PPD) into the skin and measuring the reaction after 48-72 hours. A positive reaction indicates that the person has been exposed to TB bacteria and may be at risk of developing active TB. Other diagnostic tests for latent TB infection include interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and blood tests for TB antibodies, but these are not as widely used in Africa. Chest X-ray and sputum smear microscopy are used to diagnose active TB, not latent TB infection.

###Question: Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic to Africa.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","A
Explanation: Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic to Africa. It is caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted by contact with infected animal blood or tissues. Humans can also be infected through contact with blood or tissues of infected animals, or by drinking unpasteurized milk from infected animals. Symptoms of Rift Valley fever in humans include fever, muscle pain, headache, and eye redness. In severe cases, the disease can cause hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or blindness. There is no specific treatment for Rift Valley fever, but supportive care and treatment of any complications can help improve outcomes. The disease can be prevented through vaccination of animals and by taking measures to reduce mosquito populations.",A,True,0.1818181791082543,0.07142856929489802,0.1818181791082543,0.80858177,0.89321816,0.84879535

###Question: What is a common indigenous herbal remedy used in Nigeria for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and what is its proposed mechanism of action?
###Options:
A.  Saw palmetto extract, inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase enzyme activity
B.  Yohimbe bark extract, increasing nitric oxide production and improving blood flow to the prostate
C.  Garlic bulb extract, reducing prostatic inflammation and oxidative stress
D.  African plum tree bark extract, blocking adrenergic receptors in the prostate
E.  Ginseng root extract, promoting apoptosis of prostatic epithelial cells

###Answer:","A

Rationale: Saw palmetto extract is a common herbal remedy used in Nigeria for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is proposed to work by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase enzyme activity, which is responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a potent androgen that is involved in the growth of the prostate gland. By inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase enzyme activity, saw palmetto extract may help to reduce the size of the prostate gland and relieve symptoms associated with BPH such as urinary frequency, urgency, and hesitancy.

###Options:
A.  Bloody diarrhea
B.  Projectile vomiting
C.  Rice water stools
D.  Jaundice
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","C
Explanation: 
The common presentation of African endemic cholera is rice water stools, which is a characteristic of cholera. Bloody diarrhea, projectile vomiting, jaundice, and none of the above are not common presentations of African endemic cholera. 
Rice water stools is a characteristic of cholera. It is a watery diarrhea that is usually clear or yellowish and has a characteristic appearance similar to rice water. The stools are usually voluminous, and they may contain mucus and flecks of blood. The diarrhea can be severe and may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. In severe cases, it can be life-threatening.
Bloody diarrhea is not a common presentation of African endemic cholera. While some cases of cholera may be associated with bloody diarrhea, this is not a typical presentation. In most cases, the stools are watery and may have a characteristic appearance similar to rice water.
Projectile vomiting is not a common presentation of African endemic cholera. While some cases of cholera may be associated with vomiting, this is not a typical presentation. In most cases, the stools are watery and may have a characteristic appearance similar to rice water.
Jaundice is not a common presentation of African endemic cholera. While some cases of cholera may be associated with jaundice, this is not a typical presentation. In most cases, the stools are watery and may have a characteristic appearance similar to rice water.

###Answer:","A

Rationale: The answer is TRUE. Acute appendicitis is the commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria. It is the commonest cause of acute abdomen in the world. The incidence is about 1 in 1000. It is more common in males than females. It is more common in the 3rd decade of life. It is more common in the rural than the urban population. The commonest cause is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by faecolith, with subsequent infection. The presentation is with right iliac fossa pain. The pain is usually colicky and periumbilical in location. It then migrates to the right iliac fossa. It is associated with anorexia, nausea and vomiting. There is also associated fever, rigors and malaise. The diagnosis is made by clinical examination. The patient is usually tender in the right iliac fossa. The patient may have a positive Rovsing's sign (right iliac fossa tenderness on palpation of the left iliac fossa).

###Answer:","B
Rationale:
The recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester is a three-day course of artemether lumefantrine (AL) [1]. 
The Kenyan national guidelines for the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy (MIP) were developed to provide clinicians with guidance on the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy in Kenya. The guidelines are based on the 2012 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy and the 2015 WHO recommendations for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy [1]. 
The guidelines provide information on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy, including the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), and the use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp). The guidelines also provide information on the use of antimalarials during pregnancy, including the use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and chloroquine. The guidelines also provide information on the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women with HIV. The guidelines are intended to be used by clinicians in Kenya and are not intended to be used as a substitute for clinical judgment.

Rationale: TB of GIT is a rare condition that is more common in immunocompromised patients. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the mucosa and submucosa. The lesions are often ulcerated and may be associated with perforation. The most common site of involvement is the ileocecal region, followed by the stomach, duodenum, and colon. The diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical, radiological, and histological findings. Treatment involves the use of anti-tubercular drugs for at least 6 months. Surgery is reserved for patients with complications such as perforation or obstruction.

Explanation: Ethambutol is an antimicrobial drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is used in combination with other drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin. Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing intracellular and extracellular mycobacteria. The drug inhibits the synthesis of arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, which are important components of the cell wall of mycobacteria. Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, usually in combination with other drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide.

Rationale: Anti-retroviral drugs should be started first. The goal is to suppress HIV replication and prevent HIV-associated immune suppression. The patient should be started on a first-line anti-tuberculous regimen while awaiting results of HIV testing. Once the results are available, the anti-tuberculous regimen should be modified based on HIV status. If the patient is HIV-positive, the anti-tuberculous regimen should be modified to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and to allow for the safe use of antiretroviral therapy.

###Options:
A.  GeneXpert
B.  Sputum for AAFBs
C.  TB LAM test
D.  Chest radiograph
E.  Sputum culture and sensitivity

###Answer:","A. GeneXpert

Rationale: GeneXpert is a molecular diagnostic test that detects the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and rifampicin resistance in a sputum sample in approximately 2 hours. It is currently the recommended first-line diagnostic test for adult pulmonary tuberculosis in Kenya. The test is highly sensitive and specific, and it has the advantage of being able to detect both MTB and rifampicin resistance in a single test. However, it is expensive and requires specialized equipment and trained personnel for its use. Sputum microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) is another diagnostic test that is commonly used in Kenya, but it has lower sensitivity and specificity compared to GeneXpert. Chest radiograph is a diagnostic test that can be used to assess the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis, but it is not a first-line test and it cannot detect MTB or rifampicin resistance. TB LAM test is a rapid diagnostic test that is used to detect TB in HIV-positive individuals, but it is not the recommended first-line test for pulmonary TB in Kenya. Sputum culture and sensitivity is a diagnostic test that can be used to detect MTB and determine drug susceptibility, but it takes longer to obtain results compared to GeneXpert and requires specialized laboratory equipment and trained personnel for its use.

D.  Tuberculous lymphadenitis explains the findings
E.  Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

###Answer:","A
Rationale:
A.  Cryptococcosis is the most likely diagnosis
Cryptococcal infection is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. The patient has a positive HIV test and the radiological findings are suggestive of a fungal infection. Cryptococcosis is the most common fungal infection in HIV-infected patients. Cotrimoxazole is first-line therapy in patients with HIV and pneumocystis pneumonia. Dapsone has no role in the management of cryptococcal infection. Tuberculous lymphadenitis is unlikely to explain the radiological findings. Oral corticosteroids are indicated in patients with pneumocystis pneumonia who have a low oxygen saturation.

D.  The viremia would be expected to continue rising with time
E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","C

Explanation: The patient is most likely to have developed drug resistance. The development of resistance is a common occurrence with antiretroviral therapy and is the major reason for the failure of first-line regimens. In patients who have maintained undetectable viral loads with first-line regimens for more than 6 months, a viral load of 245 copies/ml is an indication to switch to a second-line regimen. Adherence counseling and directly observed treatment are indicated in patients with detectable viral loads, but they are not indicated in this patient. An intercurrent infection may cause a transient increase in viral loads, but it is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's viremia. Laboratory variations and errors are a consideration in patients who have detectable viral loads, but they are not a consideration in this patient. A repeat viral load in 6 months would be expected to show that the viremia is continuing to rise.

The genetic barrier to resistance is the number of mutations that must occur for resistance to develop. Dolutegravir has a high genetic barrier to resistance. Enfuvirtide exerts its action by binding to gp41, which is a class of fusion inhibitors. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can be used to treat both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.

His serum Toxoplasma IgG is positive. Which of the following is the best course of action for this patient at this time?
###Options:
A.  Biopsy of the central nervous system (CNS) lesion
B.  Dexamethasone
C.  Search for systemic malignancy
D.  Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis
E.  Whole-brain radiation therapy

###Answer:","D
Explanation:
The patient has toxoplasmosis. This is the most common cause of focal brain lesions in patients with AIDS. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion in the brain, a positive Toxoplasma IgG antibody, and a negative Gram stain. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of cysts in the brain on a biopsy. A biopsy of the lesion is not necessary if the clinical and serologic findings are strongly supportive of the diagnosis. In addition, a biopsy of the lesion is not likely to change the management. The patient should be started on a treatment regimen for toxoplasmosis, which consists of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Dexamethasone should be given to patients with significant brain edema and mass effect. This patient does not have significant brain edema or mass effect. A search for systemic malignancy is not indicated because the patient does not have a history of cancer. The patient does not have a metastatic lesion to the brain. Whole-brain radiation therapy is not indicated because the patient does not have metastatic disease to the brain.",D,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7444619,0.8589574,0.7976217

Rationale: 

Nephrotic syndrome is a condition characterised by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipidemia. In this case the patient has a history of swelling and hypoalbuminemia, which is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. The dipstick result of 3+ protein and 1+ blood is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome as well. In addition, the patient is HIV positive, which is also a risk factor for nephrotic syndrome.

###Answer:","A.  4months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin; 2 months of ethambutol, Isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide

Rationale: The first line of treatment of tuberculosis is a combination of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. This combination is usually given for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for four months. Ethambutol is a drug used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given for two months, along with isoniazid and rifampicin. Pyrazinamide is a drug used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given for two months, along with isoniazid and rifampicin. The combination of these four drugs is known as the ""4-drug regimen"" or ""4-drug therapy"". This regimen is the standard of care for the treatment of tuberculosis and is effective in curing the disease in most cases. The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to the treatment. In general, the treatment duration is between 6 and 9 months. However, in some cases, treatment may need to be extended to 12 months or longer. It is important to take all the drugs as prescribed, even if you feel better, to avoid the development of drug resistance and to ensure that the disease is completely",A,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7098755,0.8517166,0.7743543

1. Breastfeeding should be encouraged because breast milk contains antibodies that help the baby to fight infection.
2. Breastfeeding should be exclusive for the first six months of the baby's life. This means that the baby should only be given breast milk and no other foods or drinks, not even water. This is because breast milk contains antibodies that help the baby to fight infection.
3. Water should be boiled before giving it to the baby. This is because water can contain bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause infection.
4. The baby's hands and surroundings should be kept clean. This is because bacteria and other microorganisms can be transferred to the baby through contact with dirty hands and surroundings.
5. The baby should be given immunizations against diseases that can cause diarrhea, such as measles, rotavirus, and cholera.
6. The baby should be given probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can help to improve the health of the gut and prevent infection.
7. The baby should be given a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables. This is because fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals that can help to improve the health of the gut.

###Question: The most common complication of measles is:
###Options:
A.  Myocarditis
B.  Laryngitis
C.  Acute encephalitis
D.  Bronchopneumonia

###Answer:","D
Explanation: Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that is spread by direct contact with infectious respiratory secretions. It is caused by the measles virus, which belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. The infection typically starts with a prodrome of fever, cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis, followed by a characteristic rash that appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash usually lasts for 3-5 days and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis. Measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. The most common complication of measles is bronchopneumonia, which is an inflammation of the lungs. This complication can occur due to the virus infecting the respiratory tract and causing inflammation and damage to the lungs. Other complications of measles include otitis media, croup, and myocarditis. Measles can also lead to encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain, and can cause seizures, paralysis, and death. Therefore, the most common complication of measles is bronchopneumonia, which is an inflammation of the lungs.

###Question: A 12-year-old boy weighing 28kg and resident in Nigeria presents with fever, poor feeding and passage of dark urine of 12 hours duration. He is severely pale, jaundiced with tender hepatomegaly of 6cm and splenomegaly of 8cm. His haematocrit reads 12% and the blood pressure is 75/60mmHg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Acute glomerulonephritis.
B.  Severe malaria.
C.  Septicaemia
D.  Viral hepatitis.

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The boy is presenting with severe malaria. The clinical features of fever, poor feeding, jaundice, pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, and the presence of dark urine are all consistent with severe malaria. The blood pressure is low, suggesting that the patient is in shock. The haematocrit is low because of haemolysis. The presence of jaundice and dark urine is a sign of haemolysis and haemoglobinuria. 
Explanation: Acute glomerulonephritis, septicemia, and viral hepatitis are all possible differential diagnoses for this patient. However, the clinical features of fever, pallor, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and dark urine are all consistent with severe malaria. The blood pressure is low, suggesting that the patient is in shock. The haematocrit is low because of haemolysis. The presence of jaundice and dark urine is a sign of haemolysis and haemoglobinuria. Acute glomerulonephritis is unlikely because there is no history of sore throat or upper respiratory tract infection. Septicaemia is unlikely because there is no history of recent fever or cough. Viral hepatitis is unlikely because there is no history of jaundice or abdominal pain.

D.  Oral doxycycline
E.  None

###Answer:","A

Explanation: 
This is a case of blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelid margins. The most common type is anterior blepharitis, which is caused by inflammation of the base of the eyelashes and the glands of Zeis. This is most commonly caused by staphylococcal infection, but can also be caused by other bacteria, such as Chlamydia trachomatis. Warm compresses and lid margin scrubs with a cotton swab dipped in diluted baby shampoo can be used to treat blepharitis, but are not the first-line treatment. The first-line treatment is erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, which is applied to the eyelids at night. Oral doxycycline can be used for more severe cases of blepharitis. Avoidance of eye makeup is also recommended, as it can irritate the eyelids and worsen blepharitis.",A,False,0.28571428107835734,0.04419889036476347,0.2539682493323256,0.84709513,0.8760481,0.86132836
