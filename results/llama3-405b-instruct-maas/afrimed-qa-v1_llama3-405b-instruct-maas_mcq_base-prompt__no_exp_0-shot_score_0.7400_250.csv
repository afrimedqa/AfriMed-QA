Physical examination reveals clenching of jaws and frequent movement of legs. He has a significant family history of alcohol use disorder in his aunt and schizophrenia in his sister. Which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the patient's condition?","MDMA (3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine), more commonly known as Molly or ecstasy, is a synthetic substance first developed in 1912 as a precursor to hemostatic synthesis agents. Due to its effects on promoting empathy and facilitating communication, the drug became popular in the early 1970s among psychiatrists for its therapeutic potential. The drug would later find heavy use in dance parties and festivals as it became prominently associated with rave culture due to its heightened euphoric effects.

The presentation of MDMA toxicity is variable due to the common practice of co-ingestion with other illicit substances. Even self-reported mono-ingestion of ecstasy/Molly is not reliable due to the synthesized drug's varying composition. Patients may present tachycardic, hypertensive, hyperthermic, and agitated. Even at minor recreational doses, adverse effects include increased muscle activity (such as bruxism, restless legs, and jaw clenching), hyperactivity, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of restlessness. The sympathomimetic properties in MDMA overdose can lead to severe toxicity manifesting as cardiovascular, neurologic, hepatic, and electrolyte disturbances. Significant elevations in heart rate and blood pressure have led to reports of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and intracranial hemorrhages. Because MDMA undergoes hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P450, severe hepatoxicity can occur, leading to fulminant liver failure. CNS hyperactivity can lead to delirium and seizures. Elevated levels of serotonin can result in serotonin syndrome, and patients may present with hyperpyrexia and myoclonus.

MDMA differs from other amphetamines due to the methylenedioxy group's attachment, which is structurally similar to the psychedelic hallucinogen mescaline. Because of this, MDMA is a chemical compound that shares properties of both amphetamines and hallucinogens. It primarily increases the overall concentration of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin within the synaptic cleft. MDMA inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin, thereby stimulating its carrier-mediated release. In addition to the depletion of serotonin-containing vesicles, this action increases serotonin synaptic levels. Like other amphetamine analogs, MDMA also inhibits monoamine oxidase activity, which further contributes to increased levels of serotonin (in addition to dopamine and norepinephrine). Like serotonin, MDMA affects dopamine transporters, promoting their release and inhibiting reuptake. The binding of noradrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic receptors contributes to the drug's noradrenaline, histamine, GABA, and acetylcholine effects. The result is a surge of activity upon postsynaptic receptors that play a role in mood, thermoregulation, and autonomic nervous system activity.

MDMA is absorbed via the GI tract with an onset of effect between 20 minutes and 1 hour after consumption. Peak concentrations occur 2 hours after oral ingestion and are broken down in the liver by the enzyme CYP2D6. MDMA has a half-life of about 8 hours, taking approximately 40 hours to clear 95% of the body's drug. Thus, continued effects of the drug will continue to linger for several hours after ingestion.",5,A,Ecstasy,Ketamine,LSD,Phencyclidine,Weed,"###Instruction: You should directly answer the question by choosing ONLY the correct option from the list of options that will be provided to you.

An x-ray of his right hand shows widening of the epiphyseal plate, and lab results confirm a vitamin deficiency. Which of the following organs is involved in the activation pathway of the deficient vitamin?","This infant presents with signs of rickets due to chronic vitamin D deficiency because breast milk has inadequate vitamin D levels to support an infant's nutritional requirements.

Dermal synthesis and dietary intake (fatty fish livers, fortified food) are the major sources of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), both of which are converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D2 (25-OH-D2) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) respectively in the liver by the enzyme hepatic enzyme 25–hydroxylase. Both 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 are then converted to the most active form of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. This active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases bone resorption, and decreases renal excretion of calcium and phosphate.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and/or severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization, which can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

Initial supplementation for 8 weeks with vitamin D3, either 6,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly, can be considered.

As ageneral rule, familial disorders such as type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndromethat result from abnormalities of structural proteins (rather than deficiencies of enzymes) and present during adulthood (rather than childhood)have what type of inheritance pattern?","There are several general clinical differences between autosomal dominant (AD) disorders andautosomal recessive (AR) disorders. In general, AD mutations usually involvecomplex structural proteins or regulatory proteins, while AR disorders are more likely to result from abnormalities of proteins that function as enzymes.Examples of AD disorders involving abnormalities of structural proteinsinclude Marfan’s syndrome (fibrillin), osteogenesis imperfecta (collagen),hereditary spherocytosis (spectrin), and several types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS; collagen). This later syndrome refers to a group of related disorders characterized by defects in collagen synthesis or structure. Thesedefects produce abnormalities of the skin and joints. The skin in thesepatients is fragile and hyperextensible, while the joints are hypermobile.There are at least 10 variants or subtypes of EDS, encompassing three typesof Mendelian inheritance. EDS types I, II, III, IV, and VIII have abnormalitiesinvolving the structural protein collagen, either collagen types I, III, or V, andall of these have AD modes of inheritance. In particular, type IV EDS isrelated to abnormal type III collagen and as such is associated with rupturedintestinal organs and blood vessels.Examples of AD disorders involving abnormalities of regulatory proteins include familial hyperlipidemia (LDL receptor), von Willebrand’s disease (von Willebrand factor), and hereditary angioedema (C1 esteraseinhibitor). Enzyme deficiencies are usually not associated with AD inheritance, because decreased levels of enzymes can usually be compensated for.Examples of AR disorders involving enzyme deficiencies include storagediseases and several amino acid diseases. Also note that, when comparedwith AD diseases, AR disorders tend to be more uniform in expression andthe age of onset is frequently early in life. Examples of this latter fact includediseases of the blood (sickle cell anemia and thalassemia) and the infantileform of polycystic renal disease, which has an AR inheritance.

These enzymes subsequently destroy the cell itself.Which of the following terms best describes this process?","Apoptosis is adistinctive pattern of cell death that is described as a “programmed suicide”process of cells through which stimulation of endogenous endonucleasescauses cleavage of nuclear chromatin. Apoptosis as originally defined is apurely morphologic process that differs from necrosis in several respects.Apoptosis involves single cells, not large groups of cells, and with apoptosis the cells shrink and there is increased eosinophilia of cytoplasm. Theshrunken apoptotic cells form apoptotic bodies, which may be engulfed byadjacent cells or macrophages. With apoptosis there is no inflammatoryresponse, the cell membranes do not rupture, and there is no release ofmacromolecules. Importantly, apoptosis is an active process in which activation of endonucleases causes peripheral condensation of chromatin (themost characteristic feature) and formation of multiples of DNA base pairfragments (called a DNA “ladder”).In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis, which is usually due to hypoxia ortoxins, involves the death of many cells or clusters of cells. With necrosisthe cells swell, and inflammation is present (cell membrane ruptures).Autophagy and heterophagy are two processes through which lysosomesdegrade macromolecules derived from either intracellular organelles(autophagy) or extracellular products (heterophagy).

Histologicsections from this ovarian mass reveal a papillary tumor with multiple,scattered small, round, laminated calcifications. Which of the following isthe basic defect producing these abnormal structures?","Calcificationwithin tissue can be classified as being dystrophic or metastatic. Dystrophiccalcification is characterized by calcification in abnormal (dystrophic) tissue,while metastatic calcification is characterized by calcification in normal tissue. Examples of dystrophic calcification include calcification within severeatherosclerosis, calcification of damaged or abnormal heart valves, and calcification within tumors. Small (microscopic) laminated calcifications within tumors are called psammoma bodies and are due to single-cell necrosis.Psammoma bodies are characteristically found in papillary tumors, such aspapillary carcinomas of the thyroid and papillary tumors of the ovary (especially papillary serous cystadenocarcinomas), but they can also be found inmeningiomas or mesotheliomas. Dystrophic calcification within tumors ofthe central nervous system (CNS), which can be seen with x-rays, is useful inthe differential diagnosis of these CNS tumors. For example, calcification ofa tumor of the cortex in an adult is suggestive of an oligodendroglioma, whilecalcification of a hypothalamus tumor is suggestive of a craniopharyngioma.Additional periventricular calcification in children is most commonly causedby infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or toxoplasmosis. With dystrophiccalcification the serum calcium levels are normal, while with metastatic calcification the serum calcium levels are elevated (hypercalcemia). Causes ofhypercalcemia include certain paraneoplastic syndromes, such as secretionof parathyroid hormone–related peptide, hyperparathyroidism, iatrogeniccauses (drugs), immobilization, multiple myeloma, increased milk consumption (milk-alkali syndrome), and sarcoidosis.",5,B,Bacterial infection,Dystrophic calcification,Enzymatic necrosis,Metastatic calcification,Viral infection,"###Instruction: You should directly answer the question by choosing ONLY the correct option from the list of options that will be provided to you.

Which of the following is the most common cause of her disorder?,"21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

21-hydroxylase deficiency leads to increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Normally, 17-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 21-hydroxylase to aldosterone and cortisol. The lack of 21-hydroxylase, therefore, leads to a deficiency of these two adrenal hormones.

The majority of affected neonates have results greater than3500 ng/dL (105 nmol/L). A very high random serum concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is highly suggestive of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Sciatica is a debilitating condition in which the patient experiences pain and/or paresthesias in the sciatic nerve distribution or an associated lumbosacral nerve root.

Any condition that may structurally impact or compress the sciatic nerve may cause sciatica symptoms. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. In the older population, lumbar spinal stenosis may also cause these symptoms. Spondylolisthesis or a relative misalignment of one vertebra relative to another may also result in sciatic symptoms.

Patients with sciatica usually experience pain in the lumbar spine, and almost invariably, the pain will be unilateral. A common characteristic is that pain may radiate to the ipsilateral affected extremity. Patients may often describe pain or a burning sensation deep in the buttocks, and they will frequently describe paresthesia that accompanies the pain. Less commonly, there are associated with ipsilateral leg weakness.
