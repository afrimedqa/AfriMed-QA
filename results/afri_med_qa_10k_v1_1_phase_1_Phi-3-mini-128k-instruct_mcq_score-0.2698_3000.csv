Each tube is covered by peritoneum and consists of three layers: serosa, muscularis, and mucosa. They traverse the superior portion of the broad ligament attached by a mesentery (mesosalpinx). It has four distinct areas in its 8- to 12-cm length: the portion that runs through the uterine wall (interstitial or cornual portion), the portion immediately adjacent to the uterus (isthmic portion), the midportion of the tube (ampulla), and the distal portion containing the finger-like fimbriae that sweep the ovum into the infundibu-lum of the tube. The fimbriae are intraperitoneal. The tubal lumen becomes increasingly more complex as it approaches the ovary. In tubal reanastomoses, the greatest success is attained when isthmic-isthmic or isthmic-ampullary regions can be reapproximated.

A. Spontaneous abortion
Explanation
The most likely cause of the symptoms described in the question is a spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage.

The most likely diagnosis is:","Acromegaly (C) is most commonly due to a pituitary tumour usually identified on MRI scan, patients most frequently present with changes in appearance followed by visual defects and headaches. Sleep apnoea is often a common complaint among patients due to weight gain. Other manifestations include large hands and feet, hirsutism, prominent and coarse facial features, carpal tunnel syndrome, hypertension, diabetes and heart failure among others. The glucose tolerance test is diagnostic for suspected acromegaly, GH levels can be measured directly, although elevated findings are not sufficient for diagnosis. Hyperthryoidism (A) produces symptoms that are usually secondary to an elevation in metabolic rate, such symptoms include diarrhoea, goitre, sweating and intolerance to the temperature whereby the patient consistently feels hot irrespective of the true environmental temperature. Sleep apnoea is not usually a complaint among patients since they often lose weight despite an increased appetite. Cushing’s disease (B) results from a pituitary tumour producing excess ACTH, the excess cortisol levels result in symptoms such as striae, bruising, thin skin, weight gain (particularly in the abdominal region) and often a dorsocervical fat pad (buffalo hump). Hypothyroidism (D) features include tiredness, depression, cold intolerance, constipation and weight gain. Patients do not tend to sweat more and the disease does not coarsen facial features.

What is the next best step in the management of this patient?","Tension pneumothorax in a hemodynamically unstable patient requires immediate treatment with needle decompression; otherwise, death may occur. The patient requires immediate management if the clinical assessment leads to a high suspicion of tension pneumothorax.

A pneumothorax is defined as a collection of air outside the lung but within the pleural cavity. It occurs when air accumulates between the parietal and visceral pleurae inside the chest. The air accumulation can apply pressure on the lung and make it collapse. The degree of collapse determines the clinical presentation of pneumothorax.

Risk factors for primary spontaneous pneumothorax include smoking, tall thin body habitus in an otherwise healthy person, pregnancy, and Marfan syndrome. Intubated patients are at high risk of developing a pneumothorax. Even on a ventilator, they will become hypoxic, with the lung unable to expand. Additionally, the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Monitoring without needle decompression may lead to death.

She is apyrexial and has a C-reactive protein (CRP) <5. You suspect an abnormality of the patient’s iron stores. What is the most appropriate investigation to determine iron store levels?","Iron deficiency can be an important cause of anaemia in patients. In this case vitamin B12 and folic acid are less likely to be important given the patient’s diet, however tea is alkaline and reduces the body’s ability to effectively absorb iron. Measuring the patient’s serum ferritin (B) provides an accurate reflection of the body’s iron stores since the serum ferritin 208 Section 7: Haematology originates from the storage pools in the bone marrow, spleen and liver. Be aware that ferritin measurements are only accurate when CRP is normal since both ferritin and CRP are acute phase reactants. The serum transferrin (C) level reflects the levels of protein that bind to iron and transports it around the body and is usually 33 per cent saturated, hence not providing the most accurate level of iron. The serum iron level (E) is a poor reflection of iron stores since this can change dependent on disease states. In iron deficiency anaemia, the serum iron and iron stores are low, however in anaemia of chronic disease iron stores are increased yet the serum iron level is reduced. The total iron binding capacity (D) specifically saturates transferrin in order to measure the iron-carrying capacity in the body rather than iron stores and so would not be appropriate here.

C. Diestel’s crisis

Diestel's crisis refers to the triad of symptoms consisting of renal colic, swelling in the loin, and the disappearance of the swelling after passing urine. This constellation of symptoms is characteristic of urinary obstruction, often due to conditions such as renal calculi or ureteral stones. Kocher's triad is associated with acute cholecystitis, Saint's triad is associated with pancreatic trauma, and Charcot's triad is associated with cholangitis.

She has no medical problems except for feeling tired all the time, which she attributes to working part-time while attending classes full-time and her many social activities. She denies depression, anhedonia, or constipation, and, although she has not gained weight, she has not lost any weight despite being on a diet for years. She has occasional heartburn, particularly after alcohol consumption, which she successfully self-treats two to three times per week with calcium carbonate, 500 mg. She admits to occasional binge drinking, once or twice yearly, but her CAGE score is 0/4. She smokes because it helps her to control her weight. On physical examination, she is slightly overweight, with a BMI of 27. Her heart rate is 68/min and her blood pressure is 188/62 mm Hg.

The patient's history of binge drinking, self-treating heartburn with calcium carbonate, and smoking to control weight are all consistent with bulimia nervosa. The physical examination findings of excoriation at the back of the throat and bilateral parotid gland swelling are also indicative of purging behaviors seen in bulimia nervosa. The electrolyte abnormalities, including mildly decreased serum potassium, slightly elevated serum bicarbonate, and mildly decreased serum chloride levels, are consistent with the metabolic disturbances commonly seen in bulimia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is less likely given the absence of significant weight loss and the patient's denial of anhedonia.

The patient's symptoms of feeling tired all the time, occasional heartburn treated with calcium carbonate, and self-reported binge drinking, along with the physical findings of an excoriation at the back of the throat and mild bilateral parotid gland swelling, are suggestive of bulimia nervosa. The use of calcium carbonate for heartburn can also be a clue to recurrent vomiting, which is a common behavior in bulimia nervosa.

It is important to note, however, that this is a variable disease and some patients may present with other joint involvement including elbows, shoulders, knees or ankles. As the disease progresses and joint damage occurs in the hands, a variety of deformities may be seen. These include ulnar deviation and palmar subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joints, Boutonniere deformity (flexion of PIPs, hyperextension of DIPs), swan-neck deformity (hyperextension of PIP, flexion of DIPs) or dorsal subluxation of the ulnar styloid.

Which of the following substances is most closely associated with the pathogenesis of this tumor?","Many chemicals are associated with an increased incidence of malignancy. These substances arecalled chemical carcinogens. Although there are direct-acting chemical carcinogens, such as the direct-acting alkylating agents that are used inchemotherapy, most organic carcinogens first require conversion to a morereactive compound. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines,and azo dyes must be metabolized by cytochrome P450–dependent mixedfunction oxidases to active metabolites. Vinyl chloride is metabolized to anepoxide and is associated with angiosarcoma of the liver, not hepatocellular carcinoma. Azo dyes, such as butter yellow and scarlet red, are metabolized to active compounds that have induced hepatocellular cancer in rats,but no human cases have been reported. β-naphthylamine is an exceptionto the general rule involving cytochrome P450, as the hydrolysis of thenontoxic conjugate occurs in the urinary bladder by the urinary enzymeglucuronidase. In the past there has been an increase in bladder cancer inworkers in the aniline dye and rubber industries who have been exposed tothese compounds.

Classic histology is defined by sheets of small, round, blue cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and neuroblastic differentiation. Desmoplastic nodular histology demonstrates nodules of tumor cells with neurocytic differentiation on a collagen-rich matrix. Large-cell anaplastic histology is characterized by large cells with abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli; they have a high mitotic index and are aggressive.

To treat her symptoms, you advise her to take indomethacin.This drug may reduce her pain because it interferes with the production ofwhich one of the following substances?","Certain drugs are important in thecontrol of acute inflammation because they inhibit portions of the metabolicpathways involving arachidonic acid. For example, corticosteroids inducethe synthesis of lipocortins, a family of proteins that are inhibitors of phospholipase A2. They decrease the formation of arachidonic acid and itsmetabolites, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. Aspirin, indomethacin, andother nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in contrast, inhibitcyclooxygenase and therefore inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins andthromboxanes. The prostaglandins have several important functions. Forexample, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced within the anterior hypothalamus in response to IL-1 secretion from leukocytes, results in fever. Thereforeaspirin can be used to treat fever by inhibiting PGE2 production. PGE2 is alsoa vasodilator that can keep a ductus arteriosus open. At birth, breathingdecreases pulmonary resistance and reverses the flow of blood through theductus arteriosus. The oxygenated blood flowing from the aorta into the ductus inhibits prostaglandin production and closes the ductus arteriosus.Therefore, PGE2 can be given clinically to keep the ductus arteriosus open,while indomethacin can be used to close a patent ductus. Prostaglandin F2(PGF2) causes uterine contractions, which can result in dysmenorrhea.Indomethacin can be used to treat dysmenorrhea by inhibiting the production of PGF2. Bradykinin is a nonapeptide that increases vascular permeability, contracts smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels, and causes pain. It is partof the kinin system and is formed from high-molecular-weight kininogen(HMWK).

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF), which is a common arrhythmia in the elderly and can present with palpitations and lightheadedness. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is appropriate for rate control in AF, especially given the patient's symptoms and the absence of signs of heart failure or ischemia. Aspirin and clopidogrel are more appropriate for anticoagulation, which is not the immediate concern here. Digoxin is not typically used for rate control in AF. Apixaban is an anticoagulant, which would be considered after rate control and assessment of stroke risk.

His symptoms developed after returning from a hiking trip to Colorado. Vital signs are temperature 98.6 F (37 C), blood pressure 110/87 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 17 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on ambient air. Physical examination demonstrates mild jaundice and normal cardiopulmonary auscultation and is negative for hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, or peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease. Lab values are as follows: total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.1 mg/dL, LDH 120 U/L, ALT 20 U/L, AST 15 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 110 U/L. Hemoglobin is 16 g/dL, reticulocyte count 1%, and haptoglobin 125 mg/dL. Given the likely diagnosis, what is the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?","Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin metabolism. The pathogenesis is thought to be secondary to either reduced conjugation of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin with uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase (UG1A1) or reduced uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by the liver. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and excreted in bile.

In addition to reduced conjugation of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin with UG1A1, reduced uptake of unconjugated bilirubin in the liver may also be important in a subset of patients.

Triggers can precipitate the development of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in patients with Gilbert syndrome. Potential triggers include stress, overexertion, fasting, intercurrent illness, menstruation, and dehydration. Patients with Gilbert syndrome exhibit mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and normal alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferase levels. Typically, there is no evidence of other disorders to explain the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Gilbert syndrome does not require treatment. When confronted with patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the healthcare provider needs to consider other causes, including but not limited to hemolytic reactions, resorbing hematomas, dyserythropoiesis, Wilson disease, and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Patients with hemolysis will exhibit an elevated reticulocyte count, high LDH, and low haptoglobin. Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism that will typically show other manifestations on physical and laboratory examinations not seen in this patient. Patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome present with much higher unconjugated bilirubin levels. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload and typically shows physical or laboratory abnormalities not seen in this patient. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis are autoimmune liver diseases and will present differently than shown in this patient.",A,Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin,Reduced copper excretion,Iron overload,Inflammation secondary to autoimmune liver disease,copper overload,"A

The patient's presentation of nasal congestion, sore throat, and yellowing of the skin following a hiking trip suggests an infectious etiology, likely viral hepatitis, which is consistent with the mild elevation in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and the presence of jaundice. The pathogenesis in viral hepatitis often involves hepatocellular injury leading to reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin, which is reflected in the elevated total bilirubin with a predominantly unconjugated fraction (as indicated by the low direct bilirubin).

Glucose-6 phosphatase catalyzes a common pathway in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6 phosphate into glucose.

This enzyme is expressed primarily in the liver, kidneys, and intestinal epithelium. Muscle cells do not express the enzyme because the glucose they produce by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis is for muscle energy needs.

CT scan of the chest is performed and shows an extensive honey-combing pattern in both lungs. As her shortness of breath and cough do not significantly improve with aggressive diuretic therapy, the decision is made to start IV methylprednisolone to decrease lung parenchyma inflammation. The next day, the patient is found to be anxious, restless, and reports seeing animals roam around her room. What is the most likely cause of this patient's visual hallucinations?","Most of the toxic effects of methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids are predictable from their impact on the body's physiology.

Glucocorticoids, depending on the dose and duration of therapy, can cause a range of neuropsychiatric complications. This patient was under chronic glucocorticoid treatment for her underlying interstitial lung disease, and the drug was discontinued upon admission to the hospital. The administration of methylprednisolone likely served as a trigger for her neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The presentation is almost always unilateral, a resting tremor in an upper limb being a common presenting feature. The tremor may eventually affect the legs, mouth and tongue. It may remain the predominant symptom for some years. Bradykinesia may develop gradually. Most patients have difficulty with rapid fine movements, and this manifests itself as slowness of gait and difficulty with tasks such as fastening buttons, shaving or writing. Rigidity, or increased muscular tone, causes stiffness and a flexed posture. Postural righting reflexes are impaired early on in the disease, but falls tend not to occur until later. As the disease advances, speech becomes softer and indistinct. There are a number of abnormalities on neurological examination, and these are listed in Box 26.77.Although the features are initially unilateral, gradual bilateral involvement is the rule. Muscle strength and reflexes remain normal, and plantar responses are flexor. There is a paucity of facial expression (hypomimia) and the blink reflex may be exaggerated and fail to habituate (glabellar tap sign). Eye movements are normal to standard clinical testing, provided allowance is made for the normal limitation of upward gaze with age.

Rationale: In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin deficiency can lead to hyperglycemia and the subsequent development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In DKA, insulin deficiency and the resulting hyperglycemia cause an osmotic diuresis that leads to the loss of electrolytes, including potassium. However, despite the total body potassium being low, the serum potassium may appear normal or even high due to the shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space in response to acidosis.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a known but rare side effect of denosumab. Symptoms may include jaw pain, tooth infection, bone, gingival erosion, and toothache. Denosumab should not be initiated until dental health is optimized.

Predisposing factors for developing osteonecrosis of the jaw include poor dentition, recent dental surgery/tooth extraction, osteoclast inhibitor therapy (denosumab, bisphosphonates), and/or concurrent antineoplastic therapy. An increased risk of being diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the jaw correlates directly to the duration of denosumab exposure.

The risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw is considerably higher in patients with malignancy receiving denosumab than in patients with osteoporosis receiving denosumab. Dental procedures are contraindicated while on denosumab for cancer therapy.",C,Poor dentition,Recent tooth extraction,Treatment of diabetes with glipizide,Treatment of bony metastases with denosumab,old age,"C.

The rationale for this answer is that glipizide, a medication used to treat diabetes, is not directly associated with causing jaw pain or dental issues. The other options (A, B, D, and E) are more likely to be related to the patient's jaw pain. Poor dentition and recent tooth extraction can lead to infections or complications in the jaw area.

His physical examination demonstrates multiple telangiectatic lesions involving the buttocks, thighs, and glans penis. His vision and hearing checks are normal. His mother is 30 weeks pregnant and worried about her fetus. She wants to know the chances that this baby may have the same disease. What is the mode of inheritance?","This child has Fabry disease, an X-linked disorder with a slight preference among males.

The disorder is an inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by absent or markedly deficient activity of alpha-galactosidase A. The disease has 2 phenotypes: the classic and late-onset phenotypes. Heterozygous females with classic phenotypes can be asymptomatic or as severely affected as males.

Enzyme deficiency results from mutations of the alpha gel A gene located on the long arm of the X chromosome. Other modes of inheritance are not known.

The defect results from a systemic accumulation of glycosphingolipids in plasma and lysosomes of vascular endothelial, smooth muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, and renal podocytes.",C,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,X-linked recessive,X-linked dominant,Sporadic,"A. Autosomal dominant

The symptoms described are characteristic of Fabry disease, which is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. However, since the question asks for the mode of inheritance and the options provided do not include X-linked, the closest correct answer would be autosomal dominant, as the question seems to be incorrectly framed. Fabry disease is typically inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, but given the options, autosomal dominant is the best choice, albeit not accurate.

Prompt treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and sodium polystyrene sulfate is initiated. One hour after initiation, the patient begins to complain of pain at his IV site. On examination, the IV site is edematous, erythematous, and tender to palpation. What is the preferred subsequent management?","The most concerning adverse effect of calcium gluconate is extravasation from intravenous sites. Calcium can induce tissue necrosis through calcium-induced vasoconstriction of capillaries and intracellular fluid retention, leading to deep tissue damage and late-onset calcifications (calcinosis cutis).

For extravasation injury treatment, stop the infusion and then gently aspirate the extravasated fluid. In early or acute calcium extravasation, a hyaluronidase antidote may be used in addition to cold, dry compresses and elevation of the extremity. 1 to 1.7 mL of hyaluronidase may be given intradermally into the border of the extravasated area as five separate injections. Injection into the catheter that caused the infiltration is also appropriate.

Calcium gluconate should be administered in large veins or via a central venous catheter to minimize the risk of extravasation injury.

Essential thrombocytosis, a type of myeloproliferative disorder, involves a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell. However, distinguishing it from more common nonclonal, reactive forms of thrombocytosis can be challenging as there is no reliable clonal marker. Only around 50% of patients with essential thrombocytosis carry the JAK2 V617F mutation. Hence, diagnosis typically relies on excluding other potential causes. Common causes of secondary thrombocytosis encompass infection, inflammatory conditions, malignancy, iron deficiency, hemorrhage, and postsurgical states. Other myeloproliferative disorders like chronic myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis, along with myelodysplastic syndromes such as the 5q-syndrome, may also lead to thrombocytosis.

X-ray of the lumber spine is reported as showing osteosclerotic metastasis in the body of L2 lumbar vertebra. Which cancer is most likely to produce bone metastases that are osteosclerotic rather than osteolytic?,Bone is the third most frequent site of metastases after the lungs and liver. Isotope bone scanning is the most sensitive method to detect bone metastases but may give false negative results in myeloma where osteoblastic activity is suppressed. In most cases bone metastases are lytic and hence radiolucent on plain X-ray imaging. Osteosclerotic metastases are radiodense and appear whiter than the surrounding normal bone as a consequence of excessive osteoblastic activity. These occur most frequently in prostate and breast cancers and occasionally Hodgkin's lymphoma. Osteosclerosis of bone metastases can also be a feature of successful treatment of bone secondaries as a consequence of bone remodelling.,E,Bladder cancer,Colorectal cancer,Lung cancer,Melanoma,Prostate cancer,"E. Prostate cancer

Rationale: Prostate cancer is most commonly associated with osteosclerotic bone metastases, which appear as areas of increased bone density on an X-ray. This is in contrast to other cancers like lung and colorectal cancers, which more frequently cause osteolytic metastases, and bladder cancer, which can cause either osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions.

What type of sounds should the clinician be listening for on physical exam?,"Understanding the terminology used to describe various breath sounds is an important skill as it helps to organize the clinician's thinking in terms of what they intend to hear and obtain from their physical exam of the lungs. Having an idea of what you expect to hear or observe is an important aspect of a physical exam. Vesicular sounds are a type of breath sound.

Breath sounds are graded by intensity, which is at a minimum what this clinician is attempting to identify. Decreased intensity of breath sounds can mean that there is some kind of pathology (such as fluid impairing ventilation in alveoli) or that ventilation itself is decreased, as is the case when an endotracheal tube enters the main stem bronchus and deprives the other lung of ventilation. Both lungs would be under-ventilated if the tube entered the esophagus. Decreased ventilation means the decreased intensity of breath sounds.

Breath sounds are also classified by their character, falling into 3 categories: Vesicular, bronchial, and bronchovesicular. This characterization is based on the anatomy that produces the sounds, and therefore each has normal territories where they are found, and if bronchial sounds are heard outside their normal territory (over the trachea and sometimes right apex), it can indicate pathology.

Misplaced endotracheal tubes (not placed into the esophagus) most often enter the right mainstem bronchus (versus left) due to its more vertical orientation.",B,Adventitious sounds,Vesicular sounds,Vocal resonance,Pleuritic sounds,rales,"B. Vesicular sounds

Rationale: When confirming the position of an endotracheal tube, a clinician should listen for vesicular sounds, which are normal breath sounds heard over most lung fields. These sounds are soft and low-pitched and are indicative of air moving through the smaller bronchioles and alveoli. If the tube is correctly placed in the trachea and not in one of the lungs, vesicular sounds should be heard bilaterally.

Polyhydramnios is frequently observed in all of the following conditions
except:

","The correct answer is D.

Polyhydramnios, which refers to an excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac during pregnancy, is frequently observed in various congenital anomalies that result in obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Let's analyze each option:

A. Esophageal atresia: Esophageal atresia, where the esophagus does not develop properly, can lead to polyhydramnios due to the inability of the fetus to swallow amniotic fluid.

B. Duodenal atresia: Duodenal atresia, a blockage in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), can cause polyhydramnios because the fetus is unable to process swallowed amniotic fluid properly.

C. Pyloric atresia: Pyloric atresia, a rare condition where there is a blockage at the outlet of the stomach (pylorus), can result in polyhydramnios due to the accumulation of swallowed amniotic fluid.

E. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia can cause compression of the fetal lungs, leading to inadequate lung development and reduced production of pulmonary surfactant. This can result in polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing and clearance of amniotic fluid.

Option D, Hirschsprung's disease, is not typically associated with polyhydramnios. Hirschsprung's disease involves the absence of nerve cells in the muscles of the colon, leading to difficulty passing stool. It is not directly related to obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract that would lead to polyhydramnios. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D,Esophageal atresia.,Duodenal atresia.,Pyloric atresia.,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,Hirschsprung's disease,"E. Hirschsprung's disease

Rationale: Polyhydramnios, which is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid, is often associated with conditions that affect fetal swallowing or gastrointestinal function, leading to decreased swallowing of amniotic fluid. Esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia, pyloric atresia, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia can all lead to polyhydramnios because they involve the gastrointestinal tract and can impair the fetus's ability to swallow amniotic fluid. Hirschsprung's disease, however, primarily affects the large intestine and does not typically result in polyhydramnios because the colon is not the primary site for amniotic fluid swallowing.",E,0.90237767,0.86407995,0.8828137,0.4153005418997283,0.17910447328051915,0.4153005418997283,False

Due to the spirochete's extremely thin structure, it is challenging to detect using light microscopy. Therefore, a specialized technique called dark-field microscopy is employed for diagnosis. Clinically, syphilis is categorized into primary, secondary, and tertiary (or late) stages.In primary syphilis, a characteristic feature is the development of a painless ulcer called a hard chancre. This ulcer typically presents with an indurated base and is commonly found on the vulva, vagina, or cervix. Secondary syphilis occurs due to the hematogenous spread of the spirochetes, resulting in a systemic infection. Various systemic symptoms may manifest depending on the major organs affected. A classic sign of secondary syphilis is a rash consisting of red macules and papules appearing on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.Late syphilis presents with manifestations such as optic atrophy, tabes dorsalis (a form of neurosyphilis affecting the spinal cord), generalized paresis (neurosyphilis affecting the brain), aortic aneurysm, and the formation of gummas (soft, tumor-like growths) on the skin and bones.",E,Aortic aneurysm,Optic nerve atrophy and generalized paresis,Tabes dorsalis,Gummas,Macular rash over the hands and feet,"C.

Based on the calculation. 2, 4 or 6 ounces are incorrect",B,2 ounces,3 ounces,4 ounces,6 ounces,16 ounces,"B. 3 ounces

Rationale:
First, calculate the total daily caloric needs: 3000 grams (or 3 kg) * 120 calories/kg = 3600 calories/day.

Next, determine the caloric need per feeding: 3600 calories/day ÷ 6 feedings/day = 600 calories/feeding.

Now, calculate the amount of formula needed per feeding: 600 calories/feeding ÷ 20 calories/oz = 30 oz/feeding.

Since the question asks for the amount in ounces and the options are in whole numbers, we convert 30 oz to ounces by dividing by 3 (since 1 ounce = 3 grams): 30 oz ÷ 3 = 10 ounces.

However, this result does not match any of the options provided, indicating a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:

Total daily caloric need: 3000g * 120 cal/kg = 360,000 calories/day.

Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, the baby weighs 3 kg.

Calories per feeding: 360,000 calories/day ÷ 6 feedings/day = 60,000 calories/feeding.

Now, calculate the amount of formula needed per feeding: 60,000 calories/feeding ÷ 20 calories/oz = 3000 oz/feeding.

This result is still incorrect. Let's try again, step by step:

Total daily caloric need: 3000g * 120 cal/kg = 360,000 calories/day.

Convert the baby's weight to kilograms: 3000g ÷ 1000 = 3kg.

Which of the following complications would not be expected during his treatment?","Tumor lysis syndrome primarily affects individuals undergoing chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating malignancies, such as acute leukemias and Burkitt’s lymphoma, though it can rarely occur in chronic lymphomas or solid tumors. The syndrome arises due to the massive destruction of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in the release of intracellular ions and nucleic acids. This cascade leads to a characteristic metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Acute kidney injury is a common complication, potentially progressing to renal failure, especially if uric acid crystallizes within renal tubules, necessitating hemodialysis. Lactic acidosis and dehydration heighten the risk of acute kidney injury.

","The correct statements regarding the scenario described are:

a. Empiric antibiotic coverage for beta-hemolytic Streptococci and Escherichia coli should be initiated: True. The sudden onset of hypoxemia, irritability, and instability in glucose and temperature in a term infant could be indicative of early-onset neonatal sepsis, which commonly involves pathogens like beta-hemolytic Streptococci and Escherichia coli. Therefore, empiric antibiotic therapy targeting these organisms should be initiated promptly.

d. The mortality rate for this child is approximately 50%: True. Early-onset neonatal sepsis, if left untreated, can have a high mortality rate. However, with prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate can be significantly reduced, but it remains a serious condition.

Other complications include systemic hemorrhage, immunologic complications, hypotension, and myocardial rupture.

Fibrinogen levels must be monitored closely in patients undergoing thrombolysis to ensure they are above 150mg/dL. When levels drop below 150mg/dL, this poses a significant bleeding risk. Treatment includes reducing and stopping the infusion rate below 100mg/dL. Platelets and hemoglobin levels should also be monitored closely as well.

Hypotension is a known risk with ""reperfusion""; however, generally, this can be controlled with infusions and will ultimately resolve as the infusion is stopped and the patient is resuscitated adequately.

What would be your initial approach in the workup of this patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria?","Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is defined by the American Urological Association as three or more RBCs per high power field on urinary sediment from two out of three properly collected urinalyses. A proper sample can be a midstream clean-catch specimen. The urine dipstick is roughly 91–100% sensitive and 65–99% specific for detection of RBCs, Hgb, and myoglobin. Urine dipstick is not reliable in distinguishing myoglobin from Hgb or RBCs. Therefore, urinalysis with microscopy should be ordered to assess the number of RBCs per high power field. Microscopic hematuria is usually an incidental finding but deserves a thorough workup, as 10% can be due to malignancy. The initial approach is to repeat the urinalysis to rule out infection. If the urinalysis suggests infection by the presence of WBCs or nitrites, a culture should be ordered and the patient treated appropriately. If RBCs are present without any leukocytes, nitrites, or epithelial cells on the repeated urinalysis, a proper workup should ensue. After history and physical are done to rule out risk factors, comorbidities, or other etiologies to account for the hematuria, one must look to diagnostic tests. A serum creatinine is useful to assess for renal insufficiency. During the course of the workup, if the urinalysis and serum creatinine suggest a glomerular etiology (casts, elevated creatinine, dysmorphic RBCs) a renal consultation and possible renal biopsy may be warranted. Evaluation of the upper tract with either an IVP or CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast should be ordered to rule out renal cell carcinoma, nephrolithiasis, or aneurysms. Next, the lower tract should be visualized by cystoscopy and washings sent for cytology.

Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated withthe development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes.These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of certain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH mayproduce Cushing’s syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin,while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroidhormone–related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance producedlocally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH). Therefore, patients with this type of paraneoplasticsyndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As aresult of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in thesepatients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder.Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venousthromboses.

Acute inflammatory processes, such aspyogenic bacterial infections and tissue necrosis, are associated with infiltratesof neutrophils into tissue and increased numbers of neutrophils in the blood;hence neutrophils are thought of as acute inflammatory cells. Neutrophils arealso called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or “polys”) because theycharacteristically have nuclei with three to five lobes. Myeloperoxidase is anenzyme within the primary (azurophilic) granules of neutrophils, while alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme in their secondary (specific) granules. Neutrophils have a short life span and do not divide. IL-1 causes an increasednumber of neutrophils to be released from the bone marrow. In contrast,chronic inflammatory processes are associated with increased numbers ofmonocytes and lymphocytes. Monocytes are mononuclear leukocytes with a“bean-shaped” or “horseshoe-shaped” nucleus. Their tissue form is called amacrophage or histiocyte. The activated form of macrophages have abundanteosinophilic cytoplasm and are called epithelioid cells. They secrete many different types of products and may fuse to form giant cells. Lymphocytes aresmaller mononuclear leukocytes that have a round to oval nucleus and littlecytoplasm. There are two types of lymphocytes, B and T lymphocytes. Thesetypes of lymphocytes look histologically identical. B lymphocytes (B cells)mature into plasma cells, which have an eccentric nucleus with a “clock-face”appearance of their chromatin. Plasma cells secrete immunoglobulin, whilecertain T lymphocytes (T cells) secrete lymphokines. Numbers of lymphocytes are increased in acute viral infections or chronic disease.",A,Neutrophils,Eosinophils,Monocytes,Lymphocytes,Plasma cells,"A. Neutrophils

She has known metastasis to the T3 vertebrae and the ribs. Since her last cycle of chemotherapy she has been very lethargic and constipated. Upon checking her bloods you discover that her corrected calcium levels are 2.95 mmol/L. The most appropriate treatment is:,"Hypercalcaemia is an important problem in cancer patients. Patients with multiple myeloma are especially likely to develop hypercalcaemia. Causes of hypercalcaemia in cancer include lytic bone metastasis or secretion of PTH-like hormones by the tumour. While patients may be asymptomatic, they can also present with lethargy, anorexia, constipation, polydipsia, polyuria, confusion and weakness. The treatment of hypercalcaemia of this level in patients with cancer is with rehydration and administration of bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate (B). Administration of chemotherapy (A) is likely to be beneficial, as it will help control the underlying malignancy. However, the immediate emergency should be addressed first. Calcitonin (C) has limited use in the treatment of hypercalcaemia as it is short-lived, painful upon administration and causes diarrhoea. Delaying the chemotherapy and advising the patient to avoid calcium (D) is inappropriate as it neither addresses the underlying problem nor treats the oncological emergency.

Volume repletion in patients with septic shock produces significant improvement in cardiac function and systemic oxygen delivery, thereby enhancing tissue perfusion and reversing anaerobic metabolism. Cardiac index will usually improve by 25–40% during fluid resuscitation. In approximately 50% of septic patients who initially present with hypotension, fluids alone will reverse hypotension and restore hemodynamic stability. Fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids, such as normal saline or lactated Ringers solution, should be the initial therapy in shock. When fluid resuscitation fails to maintain adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion, vasopressor therapy should be initiated. In this patient, the initial therapy should be fluid resuscitation. If fluid resuscitation fails, then vasopressor therapy should be initiated with dopamine. If this alone fails, then adding another vasopressor/inotropic agent, such as norepinephrine, may be warranted. Although patients with septic shock should receive broad antibiotic coverage after being pan-cultured, this should not precede fluid resuscitation.  As this patient is able to breathe independently while maintaining good O2 saturation, intubation may be held off for now. If the patient starts to deteriorate (increased respiratory rate, low O2 saturation, poor excursion, hypercapnia, hypoxia), intubation could be considered.",C,Start IV dopamine,Start empiric IV broad spectrum antibiotics,Bolus IV fluids,Intubate and start ventilator support,Start IV norepinephine,"B. Start empiric IV broad spectrum antibiotics

Rationale: In the case of septic shock, the initial management should focus on stabilizing the patient and addressing the underlying infection. Empiric IV broad-spectrum antibiotics are critical to cover a wide range of potential pathogens until the specific causative organism is identified. This is in line with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, which recommend prompt administration of antibiotics within the first hour of recognizing septic shock.",B,0.84670675,0.8073493,0.82655984,0.1493775896634012,0.02976190139455821,0.1493775896634012,False

His mother says he has experienced a gradual decline in his school performance over the last 6 months and has been acting differently. He recently underwent a drug test which came out negative for any known illicit drugs. He has also experienced weight loss of 11 lb (5 kg) and a gradually decreasing appetite. On examination, tremors are present in both upper extremities, and he is unable to write correctly. The tremors worsen when he is asked to reach for an object. An unsteady, broad-based gait is also observed. His serum transaminases are elevated, and low serum ceruloplasmin is found. The patient is placed on medication to treat his condition. How does this drug help to improve his underlying symptoms?","This 16-year-old boy with a decline in school performance, changes in personality (acting differently), tremors, ataxia, elevated liver enzymes, and low ceruloplasmin likely has Wilson disease (also known as hepatolenticular degeneration). Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B, a gene on chromosome 13 that encodes for the hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase. The primary source of copper for the body comes from the diet. Dietary copper intake is around 1-2 mg/day, and the daily requirement for copper is 0.75 mg/day; hence proper excretion of copper is crucial to prevent its accumulation in the tissues. Copper is mainly excreted into the bile and then excreted from the body in the feces.

The hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase regulates the copper needed by the body and incorporates it into aceruloplasmin (ceruloplasmin without copper) to make ceruloplasmin. Ceruloplasmin is then secreted into the bloodstream, and copper is utilized by the body (eg, iron metabolism). The hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase also secretes the excess copper into the bile. In Wilson disease, the hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase is dysfunctional, and thus there is deceased incorporation of copper into aceruloplasmin; thus, there will be low blood levels of ceruloplasmin (as in this patient) and decreased secretion of excess copper from the liver into the bile so that the copper will accumulate in the tissues.

In Wilson disease, copper especially accumulates in the liver (causing hepatitis, acute liver failure, cirrhosis), brain (dystonia, dysarthria, tremors, personality changes), the cornea (causing Kayser-Fleischer rings which are brown rings on the cornea due to copper deposition in the Descemet membrane of the cornea), joints (arthritis, commonly in the knees), and kidneys (causing Fanconi syndrome). Diagnosis of Wilson disease is by clinical features suggesting Wilson disease, Kayser-Fleischer rings on slit-lamp examination, low serum ceruloplasmin, elevated 24-hour-urine copper, abnormal liver enzymes, and ATP7B mutation analysis.

Treatment of Wilson disease is aimed at removing excess copper by using copper chelators. Penicillamine is the primary chelator used. It has a sulfhydryl group that binds to copper and secretes it through the urine. Trientine is used as a second-line copper chelator. Patients should also be advised to follow a low-copper diet.",D,Prevents intestinal absorption of copper,Increases the uptake of copper by the liver and prevents its accumulation in other tissues,Eliminates the high ammonia causing his symptoms,Chelates copper,none,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest Wilson's disease, a disorder of copper metabolism. The elevated serum transaminases and low serum ceruloplasmin are indicative of liver involvement, and the neurological symptoms (tremors, difficulty walking) are due to copper accumulation in the brain. The drug used to treat Wilson's disease is a copper chelator, which binds to copper and helps to eliminate it from the body, thereby reducing the copper overload and improving symptoms.",D,0.86282015,0.80888003,0.83497983,0.20833332993888895,0.06878306566655483,0.1999999966055556,True

Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and inhibition of this enzyme decreases the generation of uric acid from hypoxanthine, which leads to lower serum uric acid levels.

Unlike allopurinol, the structure of febuxostat does not resemble a purine or pyrimidine. However, it still forms a stable complex with xanthine oxidase and inhibits its activity. This leads to a reduction in uric acid levels and is an FDA-approved treatment for hyperuricemia.",A,Febuxostat,Colchicine,Probenecid,Celecoxib,Naproxene,"A. Febuxostat

Rationale: Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces the production of uric acid, which is the underlying cause of gout.

Certain malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, gastric bypass, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancreatic insufficiency, and cystic fibrosis may lead to vitamin D deficiency. Lower vitamin D intake orally is more prevalent in the elderly population.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The total duration of treatment is 18 months

The correct management for a child with suspected tuberculosis (TB), especially given the mother's recent diagnosis of MDR pulmonary TB, involves a comprehensive treatment plan. The total duration of treatment for TB in children is indeed 18 months, which includes an initial intensive phase of 2 months followed by a continuation phase of 16 months. This duration is necessary to ensure the complete eradication of the TB bacteria and to prevent the development of drug resistance.

Let's address the other options for clarity:

A. The intensive phase of treatment should last 4 months - This is incorrect. The intensive phase of TB treatment typically lasts 2 months, not 4 months.

C. Corticosteroids may make the condition worse - This statement is generally incorrect in the context of TB treatment. Corticosteroids are sometimes used in TB treatment to reduce inflammation and help manage symptoms, especially in cases of TB meningitis or severe TB disease. However, their use must be carefully considered and monitored due to potential side effects.

D. A lumbar puncture should not be done - This is incorrect. In cases where TB meningitis is suspected, especially in a child with fever and altered consciousness, a lumbar puncture is a critical diagnostic procedure. It allows for the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

E. One of the drugs in the intensive phase is injectable - This statement is misleading. While injectable medications (such as aminoglycosides) may be part of the treatment regimen for certain cases of TB, the intensive phase of TB treatment typically includes a combination of oral medications. The cornerstone of TB treatment is a combination of first-line anti-TB drugs, which are taken orally.

Which of the following medications is most appropriate?","Glaucoma is the second leading cause of permanent blindness in the United States and occurs most often in older adults.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) typically manifests as slow, painless damage to the optic nerve that is thought to be due to the drainage system in the eye becoming ineffective. People generally slowly lose peripheral vision but retain central vision until the disease process is severe and advanced. On comprehensive eye examination, optic nerves may have a focally notched neural retinal rim or diffuse cup enlargement, a decrease in peripheral vision detected on visual field testing, and (although not required for diagnosis) an increased intraocular pressure reading on tonometry, which is usually >21 mm Hg. Typically, changes tend to be bilateral but may not progress at the same rate, resulting in an asymmetric optic nerve cup. A cup-to-disc ratio of greater than 0.5 is considered suggestive of glaucoma and typically starts with a loss on the inferotemporal and superotemporal poles of the optic disc.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is generally managed initially with medications to lower eye pressure. Medication classes include prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, an alpha-2 agonist, miotic agents, and more recently, Rho-kinase inhibitors and nitric-oxide donating medications.

The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness, fatigue, insomnia, arthralgia, myalgia, and bone pains, along with low serum iron and ferritin, suggest iron deficiency anemia. The improvement in hemoglobin after iron supplementation supports this diagnosis. However, the presence of low vitamin D levels also indicates a deficiency, which is being treated with vitamin D3 supplementation.

Given the broad range of symptoms and the improvement with iron and vitamin D supplementation, it is important to consider other potential causes of her symptoms. The negative stool occult blood test makes gastrointestinal bleeding less likely as a cause of iron deficiency anemia. However, the patient's symptoms could also be suggestive of celiac disease, especially considering the improvement with vitamin D supplementation (as vitamin D deficiency can be associated with malabsorption syndromes, including celiac disease).

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It can lead to malabsorption of various nutrients, including iron and vitamin D, and can present with a wide array of nonspecific symptoms such as those experienced by the patient. The presence of a family history of autoimmune disease (hypothyroidism in the sister) further raises the suspicion for celiac disease.

The next best step in the treatment of this patient would be to test for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-IgA), which are highly specific for celiac disease.

clinical problems?
 

","The correct answer is a. Infection.

Branchial cleft remnants are congenital anomalies that can persist as cysts, sinuses, or fistulas due to incomplete closure of the branchial clefts during embryonic development. These remnants can become sites for the accumulation of debris and colonization by bacteria, leading to recurrent infections. Infection is the most common clinical problem associated with branchial cleft remnants, presenting as localized swelling, erythema, tenderness, and sometimes purulent drainage.

Options b, c, d, and e are less commonly associated with branchial cleft remnants:

","The correct answer is  a, b, c, d, e.

Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract that results from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct during embryonic development. It can present with various signs and symptoms, including:

a. Hemorrhage: Meckel's diverticulum can contain gastric mucosa, which may produce acid and cause ulceration, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.

b. Intussusception: Meckel's diverticulum can act as a lead point for intussusception, a condition where a segment of the intestine invaginates into the adjacent segment.

c. Volvulus: Meckel's diverticulum may undergo volvulus, where it twists upon itself, potentially leading to obstruction and ischemia of the involved segment.

d. Patent omphalomesenteric duct: Meckel's diverticulum represents a persistent remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which can remain patent and cause complications such as fistula formation or discharge from the umbilicus.

e. Right lower quadrant peritoneal findings: In cases of Meckel's diverticulum complication, such as perforation or inflammation, patients may present with peritonitis or localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

Which of the following are the most common types of primary brain tumors in this age group?,"Brain tumors are the second most common type of malignancy in childhood, second to leukemias. Within brain tumors, astrocytomas are the most common with medulloblastomas being the most common malignant brain tumor. While children can have meningiomas, they are not symptomatic until adulthood. Neurofibromas and adenomas are neither primary brain tumors nor malignant. Neurofibromas are seen in the autosomal dominantly inherited genetic disorder, neurofibromatosis.

Brain tumors often present with signs of intracranial hypertension. Due to the presence of a mass within the closed cranial vault, elevation in intracranial pressure can lead to papilledema and early morning headaches with nausea and emesis.

If intracranial hypertension continues to worsen, Cushing's triad may ensue, i.e., hypertension with reflexive bradycardia and irregular ""Cushing's"" respirations. When accompanied by pupillary changes (dilation without reactivity), impending brain stem herniation with subsequent death can be expected. Hence, emergent measures need to be taken to reduce ICP.

Patients with a diagnosis of brain tumors and intracranial hypertension need urgent brain imaging and management in a critical care setting with neurosurgical consultation. On brain imaging, midline shift, effacement of sulci/gyri/basal cisterns, and possible signs of herniation may be revealed. Maneuvers to immediately reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) include hyperosmotic therapies (mannitol vs. hypertonic saline), hyperventilation, and sedation. Thus, patients in this fragile state are often intubated. Second-line therapies to treat ICP include paralysis and cooling, to reduce cerebral metabolic activity. They may even be placed in burst suppression with a deep sedative regimen, such as pentobarbital or propofol infusions.

What is the most appropriate course of action?","Temporary hypocalcemia after removing a hyperfunctioning parathyroid adenoma is a relatively common occurrence.

Feelings of fatigue and perioral or fingertip numbness are symptoms potentially related to hypocalcemia.

Signs of hypocalcemia can include twitching of the face (demonstrable with tapping the preauricular area - Chvostek sign), involuntary flexion of the wrist with circumferential pressure over the humerus (Trousseau sign), and diastolic hypertension.

A minority of normocalcemic patients can have a demonstrable Chvostek sign in the absence of parathyroid pathology.

Beta-blockers, not finasteride, cause difficulty, specifically with ejaculation. Finasteride causes a decrease in ejaculate volume.

Finasteride can interact with other medications, which are also metabolized by cytochrome P450.

It is essential to know the interactions with cytochrome p450 because it can exacerbate the effect of a medication or make it inactive.

RBCs in the CSF can also give a false negative test.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can be type 1 or type 2. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of life-threatening sporadic encephalitis worldwide. It causes encephalitis in adults and children beyond the neonatal age. Neonatal herpes encephalitis could be either due to type 1 or type 2, the latter being more common.

Herpes simplex encephalitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children and adults. A high index of suspicion, rapid diagnostic workups, and early diagnosis with early initiation of acyclovir can further improve morbidity and mortality.

Clinical signs and symptoms are highly non-specific. Immunocompromised or elderly can have atypical or subtle presentations. Cognitive, behavioral, and personality changes could be easily misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders. Classic radiologic features that have been described include asymmetric involvement of the limbic system, abnormalities in the inferior medial temporal lobes and inferolateral frontal lobes, and the insular cortices.

Plates and screws allow absolute stability to be obtained.Plates and screws are a type of internal fixation device that can be used to hold fractures in place and promote healing. They provide absolute stability to the fracture site, which means that there is minimal motion or movement at the fracture site. Absolute stability is desirable in certain types of fractures, such as those involving joint surfaces or long bones in adults.Arthroplasty (option a) is a surgical procedure that involves removing the articular surface of a joint and replacing it with an artificial joint.

Physical examination reveals scratch marks over the body. There is no evidence of icterus, but splenomegaly is present. What is the probable diagnosis?","This patient with a history of incessant itching and burning over the body especially in the mornings, and a raised WBC count, platelet count, and splenomegaly, and a smoking history of 15-pack-years, is probably a case of polycythemia vera. The association of itching with mornings is probably due to a hot water shower owing to the cold temperatures in Atlanta. This is also known as aquagenic pruritus. Management of pruritus is an avoidance of the trigger, especially hot water. Antihistamines and topical moisturizers may help. Aspirin also helps in alleviating pruritus.

Peripheral blood smear in pre-polycythemic and overt polycythemic stage shows normochromic and normocytic RBCs, erythrocytosis with elevated hemoglobin (greater than 16.5 g/dL in male and 16.0 g/dL in female), leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. However, in concomitant iron deficiency, smear shows a microcytic and hypochromic picture. In the post-polycythemic myelofibrosis stage, blood smear is characterized by leukoerythroblastosis, with teardrop-shaped RBCs and poikilocytosis.

Janus kinase gene is a type of protein kinase which phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) in the JAK-STAT pathway, and activation of this pathway results in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).

The frequency of JAK2 V617F mutation is 95% in patients with PV.

Mast cell activation syndrome involves a positive family history and is unrelated to hot water exposure. Uremia is unlikely in this patient with mildly elevated creatinine and normal BUN.

The most appropriate investigation would be:","The patient appears to be suffering from cushingoid symptoms. After a history to exclude causes such as high-dose steroid intake, the main differential diagnoses include an adrenal tumour, an ectopic tumour producing ACTH (Cushing’s syndrome) or a pituitary tumour (Cushing’s disease). Although a 24-hour urinary free cortisol level measurement (E) does not confirm the exact diagnosis, it does indicate if there is a pathological excess of cortisol (levels can vary up to 700nmol/L in the morning to 280nmol/L at midnight). A low dose (0.5mg) dexamethasone test (A) involves measuring ACTH after dexamethasone administration. In Cushing’s disease and syndrome, there is no suppression of ACTH. A high- dose dexamethasone test (B) will differentiate between Cushing’s disease and Cushing’s syndrome since only in the former is there suppressed ACTH production after high-dose dexamethasone administration. A CT scan (D) can be used to identify a pituitary tumour if requiring surgical management. Urinary catecholamine (C) measurement is used in the diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma, an adrenal tumour producing excess catecholamines measurable in the urine. Differentiating an adrenal tumour producing excess cortisol can be done by administering metyrapone, an 11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, which effectively ceases adrenal cortisol production.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of weight gain, particularly around the waist, facial flushing, increased blood pressure, and unexplained bruising could suggest a pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor of the adrenal gland that can secrete excess catecholamines. However, the concern for a brain tumor is also valid given her symptoms. A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that can help identify or rule out a brain tumor as well as other potential causes of her symptoms. The other options are less appropriate given the symptoms described: a low-dose dexamethasone test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome, a high-dose dexamethasone test is also used for Cushing's syndrome, urinary catecholamines would be more specific for pheochromocytoma, and urinary free cortisol measurement is another test for Cushing's syndrome.",D,0.8550971,0.83332425,0.8440703,0.2857142809692285,0.07073954511471171,0.2580645113839751,False

Physical examination reveals several 2 to 3 cm bullae over the trunk and back, with a few excoriations where the blisters have ruptured, while the remainder of the skin is normal, without erythema or scale.","Bullous diseases are potentially serious conditions characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin. Blisters smaller than 0.5 cm are termed vesicles, while larger lesions are called bullae. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of bullous disorders are essential to prevent skin denudation resembling burns and associated infections, which can lead to disability or even death.While various skin conditions like allergic contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and bullous impetigo can cause blisters, this patient's presentation is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus, both of which are immunologically mediated disorders. Skin biopsy with immunofluorescence staining typically reveals antibodies at the basal layer of the epidermis for bullous pemphigoid or within the epidermis for pemphigus. Pemphigus often involves mucosal surfaces, particularly the oral mucosa. Treatment usually involves immunosuppressive agents, including systemic corticosteroids.Antihistamines may provide some relief if itching is prominent but do not address the underlying condition.

The maternal heart rate jumps to 130 bpm and her blood pressure is now 90/50 mm Hg. The patient is brought to the operating room for an emergent cesarean birth. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this event?","This patient has signs and symptoms concerning for uterine rupture: fetal bradycardia, sudden-onset severe abdominal pain that is not masked by an epidural, and maternal hemodynamic instability. Another key finding often present is a loss of fetal station.

The biggest risk factor for uterine rupture is a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). The incidence of uterine rupture in an unscarred uterus is roughly 1 rupture per 10,000 to 25,000 deliveries. The incidence of uterine rupture for women in labor with 1 previous cesarean delivery is approximately 0.3% to 1%. The incidence increases in patients with more than 1 cesarean birth, though the exact increase is somewhat unclear; estimates range from 0.9% to nearly 4%.

The study cited in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin noted the risk of uterine rupture was 0.9% and 1.8% in women with 1 versus 2 prior cesarean births. ACOG notes that a TOLAC is reasonable to offer appropriately selected well-counseled patients with 2 prior cesarean births.

The risk of uterine rupture is slightly higher in women of advanced maternal age who undergo a TOLAC compared to younger women. Multiparty and induction of labor are also risk factors for uterine rupture. These risk factors have a much smaller effect on the rate of uterine rupture, however, than a TOLAC.Of note, the use of misoprostol is contraindicated in patients undergoing TOLAC due to a significant increase in uterine rupture risk. For this reason, mechanical dilation and oxytocin are recommended over prostaglandins in parturients requiring induction or augmentation while undergoing a TOLAC.

The most significant risk factor for the event described is the trial of labor after cesarean birth (TOLAB). This is because the patient's history of two prior cesarean deliveries puts her at a higher risk for uterine rupture, especially during labor induction. The mechanical cervical dilation and oxytocin administration are part of the induction process and not risk factors in themselves.

The most important investigation to confirm this diagnosis is:,"The diagnosis of asthma is predominantly clinical and based on a characteristic history. Supportive evidence is provided by the demonstration of variable airflow obstruction, preferably by using spirometry . The measurement of FEV1 and VC identify the obstructive nature of the ventilatory defect, define its severity, and provide the basis of bronchodilator reversibility . If spirometry is not available, a peak flow meter may be used. Patients should be instructed to record peak flow readings after rising in the morning and before retiring in the evening. A diurnal variation in PEF (the lowest values typically being recorded in the morning) of more than 20% is considered diagnostic and the magnitude of variability provides some indication of disease severity  A trial of corticosteroids (e.g. 30 mg daily for 2 weeks) may be useful in documenting improvement in either FEV1 or PEF to establish the diagnosis.It is not uncommon for patients whose symptoms are suggestive of asthma to have normal lung function. In these circumstances, the demonstration of AHR by challenge tests may be useful to confirm the diagnosis . AHR is sensitive but non-specific; it therefore has a high negative predictive value but positive results may be seen in other conditions such as COPD, bronchiectasis and CF.

The provider decides to prescribe a drug that can target both elevated mood and depressive episodes. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of this drug in alleviating the patient's symptoms?","The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with bipolar disorder. The mechanism of action of valproic acid in the treatment of bipolar disorder involves the enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission.

Valproic acid inhibits the enzyme GABA transaminase, leading to increased levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood and reducing neuronal excitability. By enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission, valproic acid helps stabilize mood and manage manic and depressive episodes in patients with bipolar disorder.

Valproic acid is an effective mood stabilizer used to treat both manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder.

Modulation of serotonin and norepinephrine levels and blockade of dopamine receptors are mechanisms associated with other medications used to treat bipolar disorder but not specific to valproic acid.

Organophosphates are notoriously found in pesticides and insecticides. Anyone who handles these types of substances is at risk for developing cholinergic toxicity.

This patient is experiencing cholinergic toxicity. This can commonly come in the form of organophosphate poisoning through pesticide exposure.

Sometimes exposures will be more apparent when several patients present with similar symptoms. It is easy to extract that those patients may have suffered exposure to the same toxin/substance. Early recognition of the exposure is important for early treatment and improved mortality. Getting the information about the patient's job and if anyone else has similar symptoms may cue the physician into organophosphate exposure and cholinergic toxicity as a result.

He has excoriations on his elbows and knees and scattered papulovesicular lesions in these regions as well.Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?","The patient has chronic diarrhea superimposed on a long history of loose stools, steatorrhea, and significant weight loss. While these features could be seen in several diseases, the presence of the pruritic vesiculopapular lesions on his extensor surfaces makes the diagnosis highly likely to be celiac sprue, with its frequently accompanying skin manifestation  dermatitis herpetiformis. Crohn’s disease is not usually associated with steatorrhea, and ulcerative colitis is often associated with bloody stools. Chronic pancreatitis and Whipple disease could cause a similar clinical picture but would not have the associated skin findings. A small bowel biopsy would confirm histopathologic features consistent with celiac sprue, such as villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia.  A small bowel biopsy could also diagnose or rule out Whipple disease by looking for the pathognomonic PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) positive organism  Tropheryma whippelii. Colonic biopsies would be unhelpful in celiac sprue.  A fecal fat quantification would likely confirm and assess the degree of steatorrhea, but would offer little other diagnostic information.  A small bowel x-ray is too nonspecific to confirm the diagnosis and an abdominal CT scan would likely be normal unless the patient had developed a complication of advanced sprue, such as intestinal lymphoma.

On examination, the patient has a symmetric abdomen, with localized tenderness over the right upper quadrant on light and deep palpation, without rebound or guarding. CT scan reveals numerous cysts in the patient’s liver. Which of the following serious adverse effects is the patient at risk for developing?","This patient, with a 2-week history of pain in the right upper quadrant, swelling in the abdomen, and chest pain, who recently traveled to South America and was exposed to livestock, is most likely infected with Echinococcus granulosus. Echinococcus granulosus infections cause cystic echinococcosis, also called hydatidosis. Hydatidosis results from a larval infection of the tapeworm (cestode) Echinococcus granulosus. The disease characteristically demonstrates the growth of hydatid cysts (metacestode) in internal organs (including the liver) of intermediate hosts. The definitive hosts of the cestode are carnivores such as dogs. Humans and other hosts ingest eggs or gravid proglottids that are excreted in the definitive host's feces, causing the infection.

A serious adverse effect that may result from rupture hydatid cysts is anaphylaxis. Treatment for Echinococcus granulosus is the PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration) procedure. This procedure is an ultrasound-guided, minimally invasive modality used in hepatic and other abdominal cysts. Indications include inoperable patients, relapsing cases after surgery, and failure to respond to medical treatment. It provides the best results in CE1, and CE3a cysts over 5cm and is used in combination with medical therapy (BMZ). It is contraindicated in for CE2, CE3b, CE4, and CE5 cysts. Physicians performing this procedure must be equipped to deal with the potential anaphylactic shock. Other percutaneous treatment can be used, but are usually reserved for CE2 and CE3b cysts.

In symptomatic patients, one has to remove the entire cyst without rupture. One should never attempt to aspirate hydatid cysts because of the risk of cyst rupture and anaphylaxis. Lung may have to be resected if the underlying parenchyma has been damaged. To kill cysts, one can instill hypertonic saline in the cyst at the time of enucleation.

In addition to the risk for anaphylaxis, the rupture of the cyst, whether spontaneous or traumatic, can cause site-specific complications.

She is experiencing occasional low back pain and fatigue. The low back pain is constant in nature, and does not feel like contractions. On physical examination, she is in no acute distress and is afebrile, with a pulse of 76/min, blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 22/min. Fundal height is 34 cm. Pelvic examination reveals fluid in the vaginal canal. The patient comments that she noticed it, but wasn’t worried because it wasn’t bloody. She says she really is not sure if the fluid has any odor or not. She also denies any vaginal irritation. In addition to standard 32–36 week testing (chlamydia and gonorrhea cultures, repeat hematocrit, and Group B streptococcal screening), a nitrazine blue test is performed; results are positive. What conclusions may be drawn from this test?","The correct answer is E. This patient’s presentation is consistent with both premature rupture of membranes and BV, given only the positive nitrazine paper test. Nitrazine tests nonspecifically for alkaline vaginal fluid, which may be amniotic fluid or the alkaline vaginal secretions associated with BV. At this point, no definite conclusion may be drawn. Further tests would include a wet mount in which case clue cells, or epithelial cells studded with bacteria, would be indicative of BV and evidence of ferning would suggest premature rupture of membranes. Although BV is normally associated with a foul odor, it is also notable for a lack of vaginal irritation, unlike other vaginoses.",E,This patient has candidiasis,This patient has placenta previa,This patient has normal vaginal secretions,This patient is in premature labor,This patient may have premature rupture of membranes or bacterial vaginosis,"E. This patient may have premature rupture of membranes or bacterial vaginosis


Rationale: A positive nitrazine test indicates the presence of amniotic fluid, which is alkaline, and therefore not normal vaginal secretions. This finding, along with the presence of fluid in the vaginal canal, suggests that the amniotic sac may have ruptured prematurely. The absence of odor does not rule out bacterial vaginosis or premature rupture of membranes.",E,0.8898088,0.8579765,0.8736027,0.36799999526912003,0.08641974842249683,0.28799999526912007,True

The most common cause of chronic type B gastritis is use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but our patient lacks this history. The incidence of chronic gastritis increases with age and the histologic appearance improves with the treatment of H. pylori. Symptoms of chronic gastritis may include pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, this condition is frequently asymptomatic.

He notes that he has had previous wounds at this location, which have healed in the past, but this one has not. He denies systemic symptoms but admits having trouble getting around, as his feet and lower legs get painful with walking. On physical exam, there is rubor less than 2 cm around the border, trace serous drainage in the wound, a fibrotic base, and a thickened, raised border, and the area is tender to palpation. There is limited bleeding on debridement due to the fibrotic base's thickened nature. The patient's pulse is faint, and the skin on the feet is atrophic and dry.

When gathering more information from the patient, which of the following is most likely to be found in his social history?","Heavy alcohol consumption is a common cause of avascular necrosis of the femoral head and is referred to as alcohol-induced osteonecrosis. The pathophysiology is not entirely understood but is believed to be the result of bone marrow fat cell hypertrophy and serum lipid changes leading to blood vessel occlusion, increased intraosseous pressure, and ultimately lack of perfusion.

Trauma alone is a common cause of the osteonecrosis of the femoral head. It results in 15-50% of femoral neck fractures, and 10-25% of hip dislocations. This patient's risk is compounded by excessive alcohol use, which decreases bone density and allows fractures to occur more quickly.

Ascertaining history of alcohol use when interviewing a patient with suspected avascular necrosis of the femoral head is essential to formulate a differential diagnosis. Additionally, this patient’s car accident may have been the result of driving under the influence.

Clinically, PJP can present as pneumonia with acute respiratory failure. Complications like pneumothorax and respiratory failure are poor prognostic signs.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is very difficult to culture; thus, silver stains are used to identify the cyst. Bronchoscopy lavage is required to obtain a lower respiratory tract specimen. When stained, it reveals the cyst wall or the trophozoite. Numerous disc-shaped or cup-shaped yeasts are visible along with the eosinophilic foamy alveolar materials.

The treatment of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Corticosteroids should be added for severely impaired oxygenation. Prophylaxis with TMP-SMX is indicated in patients with HIV/AIDS when the CD4 count is less than 200/mm3.

Silver staining can be used to detect various other fungi like Cryptococcus or Histoplasma and the bacterium Legionella. Cryptococcus usually causes meningoencephalitis (""soap bubble"" lesions on brain imaging) in immunocompromised and immune-competent patients. It is an encapsulated yeast with narrow budding.

W,"Hyperemia refers to excessamounts of blood within an organ. It may be caused by increased arterialsupply (active hyperemia) or impaired venous drainage (passive hyperemia). Examples of active hyperemia include increased blood flow duringexercise, blushing (such as embarrassment associated with being asked aquestion during a lecture), or inflammation. Examples of passive hyperemia, or congestion, include the changes produced by chronic heart failure. These changes include chronic passive congestion of the lung or theliver. The lung changes are characterized by intraalveolar, hemosiderinladen macrophages, called “heart failure cells.” Congestion in the liver ischaracterized by centrilobular congestion, which is seen grossly as a“nutmeg” appearance of the liver. In contrast to hyperemia, hemorrhagerefers to the leakage of blood from a blood vessel. Blood may escape intothe tissue, producing a hematoma, or it may escape into spaces, producinga hemothorax, hemopericardium, or hemarthrosis.

His friend says he frequently consumes different substances for fun, most recently about 90 minutes ago. Physical examination reveals miosis and nystagmus. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?","Phencyclidine (PCP) is available as a powder, crystal, liquid, and tablet. It produces both stimulation and depression in the CNS. PCP is a non-competitive antagonist to the NMDA receptor, which causes analgesia, anesthesia, cognitive defects, and psychosis.

Depending on the dose, administration route, and co-ingestants, PCP can cause a wide spectrum of clinical effects, from a coma to extreme agitation or psychosis. Often, patients cannot give a clear history, so it is imperative to attempt to obtain a history from emergency medical personnel, family, friends, and witnesses. Familiarity with the street names for PCP can be helpful as well.

The evaluation should include serum PCP level, fingerstick blood glucose, complete blood count, electrolyte panel–BUN and creatinine, creatine kinase, acetaminophen, and salicylate levels, and electrocardiogram. Consider CT of the head to rule out other causes of altered mental status and cerebral spinal fluid evaluation to rule out CNS infection. A urine toxicology screen can help identify coingestions but may not be helpful to identify acute PCP intoxication because chronic PCP users can have a positive test weeks after their last use. False positives occur for PCP with methadone, ibuprofen, venlafaxine, and chlorpromazine use. Liver function tests are elevated in 50% of cases with PCP toxicity. Urinalysis shows elevated myoglobin levels. Imaging studies should be performed when there is a concern for trauma secondary to PCP intoxication.

Most patients survive PCP intoxication with supportive care. Airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic monitoring are essential to patients' care with PCP toxicity. Intubation with ventilatory support may be required for airway protection. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary in PCP ingestions; however, activated charcoal may be beneficial with massive ingestion of PCP or a dangerous coingestion. Activated charcoal therapy should only be started within 1 hour from the time of ingestion. The activated charcoal dose is 1 g/kg, with a maximum dose of 50 g. Ketamine toxicity has a similar presentation but is shorter acting.",B,Cocaine,Phencyclidine,Ketamine,Alcohol,Weed,"B

Phencyclidine (PCP) is known for causing hallucinations, nystagmus, and a sense of detachment from the environment, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.

Physical examination finds a young boy in moderate respiratory distress with inflamed and edematous regions involving his epiglottisand uvula. Material from his inflamed epiglottis is cultured and grow coloniesof Hemophilus influenzae. This bacteria has increased amounts of sialic acid,which can inhibit the alternate complement system. That is, organisms withincreased amounts of sialic acid, such as Streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, need to be killed by the classic complementpathway. Which of the following substances is most likely to activate the classic complement pathway?","The complement system is a cascade of plasma proteins whose basic function is the direct lysis of cells,attraction of leukocytes to sites of inflammation (chemotaxis), and activation of leukocytes. The complement system can be activated by one of twobasic pathways. The classic pathway is initiated by antigen-antibody(immune) complexes binding to C1. The antibodies that are involved informing these complement-activating immune complexes are IgM and IgG(subtypes 1, 2, and 3). There are also some non-immunologic activators ofthe classic complement pathway, such as urate crystals, which may be partof the pathophysiologic process of gout. In contrast, with the alternate complement pathway the early complement components (C1, C4, and C2) arebypassed and C3 is activated directly by such things as bacterial endotoxins, cobra venom factor, lipopolysaccharide, and aggregated immunoglobulin(mainly IgA, but also IgE). C3 nephritic factor is an unusual substance capable of activating the alternate complement system within the glomerulus,producing glomerular injury.Finally, the mechanism through which organisms with increasedamounts of sialic acid can inhibit the activation of the alternate complementsystem is as follows: first note that normally low levels of C3 in the blood areconverted into C3a and C3b by a slow process called “C3 tick-over.” The C3bmay combine with factor B to form C3bB, which subsequently will react withfactor D and properdin, both of which are part of the alternate complementpathway. Some of the C3b formed by “C3 tick-over” may instead attach tofactor H. This will cause C3b to be inactivated by being converted to C3bi byfactor I. This attachment to factor H is increased by sialic acid.",E,Aggregated IgA,Aggregated IgD,C3 nephritic factor,IgE bound to antigen,IgG bound to antigen,"E. IgG bound to antigen

Rationale: The classic complement pathway is typically activated by antibodies bound to antigens, which is a process known as the classical pathway activation.

These clinical signs are consistent with an X-linkedrecessive disorder that is caused by the deficiency of an enzyme that normally participates in which one of the following biochemical processes?","Purinesynthesis involves adding carbons and nitrogens to ribose 5-phosphate (R5P),which is a product of the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt. R5P is thenconverted to ribose phosphate pyrophosphate (RPPP), which is subsequently converted to 5′-phosphoribosylamine, the latter step being the committedstep in purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Through a series of steps RPPP is converted to inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP). Several of these biochemical stepsinvolve transferring methyl groups from folate. This is important becausefolate analogues, such as methotrexate, inhibit DNA synthesis, especially inrapidly growing tumor cells, by inhibiting purine synthesis. Finally IMP isconverted into either adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or guanosinemonophosphate (GMP). These last biochemical steps are also connected tobiochemical reactions that involve adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that isdeficient in individuals with the autosomal recessive form of SCID, andhypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), an enzyme ofthe purine salvage pathway for recycling guanine and hypoxanthine that isdeficient in individuals with the X-linked recessive disorder Lesch-Nyhansyndrome.

There is also clinical evidence of poor peripheral perfusion. What is the diagnosis?,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitisThe presence of periorbital and facial oedema with normal blood pressure in this toddler indicates that he has nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individual’s health and quality of life:Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the development of a bacterial infection in the peritoneum, despite the absence of an obvious source for the infection. It is specifically an infection of the ascitic fluid – an increased volume of peritoneal fluid. Ascites is most commonly a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. It can also occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome. SBP has a high mortality rate.The diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis, a sampling of the peritoneal fluid taken from the peritoneal cavity. If the fluid contains large numbers of white blood cells known as neutrophils (>250 cells/µL), infection is confirmed and antibiotics will be given, without waiting for culture results. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually administered.Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, general malaise, altered mental status, and worsening ascites. Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms. In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy, and where there is no other clear causal indication for this, SBP may be suspected.These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) and therefore make a differentiation difficult.

It has been postulated that iron deficiency induces iron-dependent enzyme dysfunction, leading to oxidative stress and DNA damage in the epithelia of the esophageal mucosa. Repeated injury to epithelia due to iron deficiency leads to atrophy of mucosa and degradation of pharyngeal muscles, leading to the development of esophageal webs.

Although PVS is a rare diagnosis, there should be high clinical suspicion in patients with iron-deficiency anemia, one or more esophageal webs, and post-cricoid dysphagia.

Aspiration of frank pus from the pleural space during thoracocentesis invariably needs drainage and potential surgery if there is uncertainty about whether a turbid fluid is infected; a pleural fluid pH of less than 7.2 warrants a procedure for drainage.

Drainage of the parapneumonic effusion is recommended as it appears to be an empyema. This can be performed via a chest tube at the bedside or possibly image guided if the fluid is not free-flowing and needs CT-guided imaging for placement.

The process of apoptosis hastwo basic phases: an initiation phase, during which caspases are activated,and an execution phase, during which cell death occurs. The initiationphase has two distinct pathways: the extrinsic (receptor mediated) pathway and the intrinsic (or mitochondrial) pathway. The extrinsic pathway ismediated by cell surface death receptors, which are members of the tumornecrosis factor receptor family. These receptors contain a cytoplasmic deathdomain (DD). Two examples of death receptors are type 1 TNF receptor(TNFR1) and Fas (CD95). Fas ligand (FasL), which is produced by immune cells, stimulates apoptosis by binding to Fas, which activates thecytoplasmic Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), which in turnactivates the caspase cascade via the activation of caspase 8. Similarlytumor necrosis factor (TNF) binds to TNFR1 and the complex activates thecytoplasmic TNF-receptor-adaptor protein with a death domain (TRADD),which in turn activates FADD. Another function of TNF, however, is to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) by degrading aninhibitor of NF-KB called IKB.In contrast to the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway does notinvolve death receptors and instead results from increased permeability ofmitochondria. For example, cytochrome c can be released into the cytoplasm from mitochondria via bax channels, these channels being upregulated by p53. Cytochrome c then binds to and activates apoptosisactivating factor 1 (Apaf-1), which then in turn stimulates the caspase cascade. Note that the product of the bcl-2 oncogene, which is normallylocated on the outer mitochondrial membrane, endoplasmic reticulum,and nuclear envelope, inhibits apoptosis by blocking bax channels and bybinding to and sequestering Apaf-1.",C,BCL2 product blocks bax channels,Cytochrome c activates Apaf-1,FADD stimulates caspase 8,FADD stimulates caspase 8,TRADD stimulates FADD,"D.

","The correct answer is:

D. No further treatment.

In an 85-year-old man with incidental foci of adenocarcinoma found on histological examination after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), the management approach may involve observation or active surveillance rather than immediate intervention. Given the patient's age and the likelihood that the cancer is low-grade and localized, the risks associated with additional treatment such as surgery or hormonal therapy may outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, in many cases, no further treatment may be indicated, and the patient may be monitored closely for any signs of disease progression.

Rationale: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a procedure often performed to relieve symptoms of an enlarged prostate, not typically for treating prostate cancer. However, if adenocarcinoma is found in the specimen, the presence of cancer would necessitate further treatment, which could include radical surgery, especially considering the patient's age and the potential aggressiveness of prostate cancer.

She is anxious that she may have cancer as her friend told her that ''neck lumps are generally fatal''. The swelling is determined to be a solitary, mobile nodule. An ultrasound is done, which reveals a small round lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid, without any calcifications or surrounding tissue changes. The nodule has a uniform echotexture. An FNA performed reveals a follicular neoplasm.

Which of the following is most likely to provide a diagnosis?","The presence of headache, eye pain, nausea, and vomiting should prompt the consideration of the diagnosis of acute angle closure glaucoma. This is a rare but serious condition in which the aqueous outflow is obstructed, and the intraocular pressure abruptly rises. Susceptible eyes have a narrow anterior chamber and when the pupil becomes dilated, the peripheral iris blocks the outflow via the anterior chamber angle. Edema of the cornea occurs, resulting in cloudiness on examination. Diagnosis is made by measuring the intraocular pressure during an acute attack. Treatment includes medications to induce miosis in an effort to relieve the blockage or, if that fails, surgical intervention. In some patients, the headache or GI symptoms can overshadow the ocular symptoms, resulting in a delay in diagnosis and unnecessary workup for other conditions. In this case, the lack of findings on abdominal examination makes appendicitis or perforated bowel unlikely. DKA can present with primarily GI symptoms, but would not explain the ocular symptoms. Similarly, cerebellar or other brain tumors may cause headache, nausea, and vomiting, but would not be causes of a painful, red eye.

Definitive treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma involves peripheral iridotomy. The goal of medical treatment is to reduce intraocular pressure in preparation for surgery. Pharmacologic treatments which are commonly used to decrease intraocular pressure include oral or intravenous acetazolamide, topical beta-blockers, topical pilocarpine, and topical alpha-adrenergic agonists. Patients may also be placed in a supine position to relieve some of the increased intraocular pressure. Since acute angle-closure glaucoma involves a problem with the pupil being fixed in a dilated position, induction of further pupillary dilation for the purpose of ophthalmoscopic evaluation carries with it a risk for exacerbation of symptoms.",E,abdominal ultrasound,emergency exploratory laparascopy,MRI of the brain,arterial blood gas,ocular tonometry,"C.

The pain is on the lateral shoulder, does not radiate, and is worse with overhead activity. She has pain at night when trying to sleep on her side, and has tried taking over-the-counter ibuprofen intermittently for pain relief. She denies any history of trauma or injury. She states that her normal activities include gardening, yoga, pickleball, and walking. The patient is right-handed. On physical examination, her symptoms are reproduced with both empty and full can test, and there is no external rotation lag sign. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a <50% supraspinatus tear. Which of the following treatments is recommended?","With the chronicity of her likely rotator cuff injury/tear, she would fit best as a group 2 patient. This grouping is for patients who may have surgical indications, but physical therapy is of equal benefit in the short term.

It can take from 6-12 weeks to see results from therapy. The best predictor of failure is a patient who does not believe rehabilitation can be effective at improving their pain and function.

Corticosteroids have never been shown to be of benefit in the healing of a rotator cuff tear. There is some literature showing an initial weakening of the tendon in the short term (14 days). These injections can be most effective in short-term pain relief. Caution should be exercised to avoid injecting directly into the tendon.

The natural history of cuff disease is for the tear to progress, but this generally happens when the tear is larger than 50%. The progression of the tear happens slowly, thus allowing time to see if the patient responds to this treatment. Rotator cuff tears are prevalent.

The most likely explanation for his reluctance to start insulin therapy is needle phobia. This is a common fear that can cause significant distress and avoidance behavior in individuals who have to inject themselves with medication. The patient's history of an adverse drug reaction to warfarin, rather than an allergy to insulin, makes an allergy less likely.

Initially, this may only cause local irritation. However, as the obstruction persists, symptoms may escalate, manifesting as increased pain and the appearance of a purulent, foul-smelling, bloody discharge. When unilateral nasal discharge is present alongside obstruction, it suggests the possibility of a nasal foreign body and warrants examination. While polyps could potentially cause unilateral nasal obstruction, they are uncommon in children of 18 months and might indicate a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis, though not impossible, is rare in black children. Frontal sinusitis typically doesn't result in unilateral symptoms, and sinusitis is uncommon in an 18-month-old child due to incomplete sinus development at that age. Similarly, a deviated septum is not typically found in young children.

Laboratory tests demonstrate a prolonged PT and PTT. This woman most likelyhas a deficiency of which one of the following vitamins?","Vitamin K compounds include phylloquinone (K1), which is the major form of vitamin Kin plants, and menaquinone (K2), which is produced by bacteria. Up to 50%of the vitamin K needed by the body is provided by the normal bacteria ofthe GI tract. Therefore a deficiency of vitamin K can result from a decreasein the normal number of vitamin K-producing bacteria in the gut, which inadults can result from the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In neonatesvitamin K deficiency can result from inadequate colonization of the gut bybacteria or rarely from breast milk, which is low in vitamin K. This deficiency in neonates can result in hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, whichtypically occurs prior to day 7 of life. In adults, a deficiency of vitamin K canalso result from a dietary deficiency or decreased absorption, which canresult from fat malabsorption, pancreatitis, or diffuse liver disease.Vitamin K is required for the posttranslational conversion of glutamylresidues in some proteins into gamma-carboxylates. It participates in thehepatic carboxylation of four procoagulants (factors II, VII, IX, and X) andplasma proteins C and S. For these four proclotting factors, this gammacarboxylation provides the calcium-binding sites necessary for the calciumdependent interaction with a phospholipid surface. Because of this, adeficiency of vitamin K produces a bleeding diathesis characterized byhematomas, ecchymoses, hematuria, melena, and bleeding from the gums.Laboratory tests reveal an increased bleeding with prolonged PT and PTTand normal bleeding time.In contrast, a deficiency of vitamin A is associated with night blindness, dry eyes, dry skin, and recurrent infections; a deficiency of vitamin B1(thiamine) with beriberi; a deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) with sideroblastic anemia, and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) with scurvy.",E,Vitamin A,Vitamin B1,Vitamin B6,Vitamin C,Vitamin K,"E.

Microscopic examination of a series of peripheral blood smearstaken during the course of a staphylococcal infection indicates that the bactericidal capacity of the boy’s neutrophils is impaired or absent. Which ofthe following is the most likely cause of this child’s illness?","Patientswith chronic granulomatous disease have defective functioning of phagocyticneutrophils and monocytes due to an inability to produce hydrogen peroxide.That is, their phagocytic cells have a decreased oxidative or respiratory burst.The most common cause of chronic granulomatous disease is defectiveNADPH oxidase, which is an enzyme on the membrane of lysosomes thatconverts O2 to superoxide and stimulates oxygen burst. This deficiency resultsin recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms, such as S. aureus. Theclassic form of chronic granulomatous disease usually affects boys and causesdeath before the age of 10. Key findings in chronic granulomatous diseaseinclude lymphadenitis, hepatosplenomegaly, eczematoid dermatitis, pulmonary infiltrates that are associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, anddefective ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria.A defect in the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) is seen in theautosomal recessive (Swiss) form of severe combined immunodeficiencydisease (SCID), while a defect in the IL-2 receptor is seen in the X-linkedrecessive form of SCID.

Most North American patients affected by this condition are descendants of Ulster Scots who arrived in Nova Scotia in 1761 on the ship Hopewell. The disorder primarily affects males through X-linked recessive inheritance, involving inactivating mutations of the vasopressin V2 receptor. However, autosomal dominant and recessive forms also exist. The disorder is thought to arise from primary unresponsiveness of the distal tubule and collecting duct to vasopressin. While present at birth, the diagnosis is often delayed until several months later when symptoms such as excessive thirst, frequent voiding of large volumes of dilute urine, dehydration, and failure to thrive become evident. Therapy for this incurable disease primarily involves maintaining adequate fluid intake, dietary management, and the use of saluretic medications to promote sodium excretion in the kidneys.Acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can result from various medications (such as lithium, methicillin, rifampin, and amphotericin) and may also be associated with conditions like hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, polycystic kidney disease, Sjögren syndrome, and sickle cell disease.Water intoxication would not manifest with episodes of dehydration.

She also has a history of recurrent pains in her legs secondaryto recurrent thrombosis. Her symptoms are most likely due to a deficiency ofwhich one of the following substances?,"Two important control points of the coagulation cascade arethe fibrinolytic system and certain plasma protease inhibitors. The maincomponent of the fibrinolytic system is plasmin, which is converted fromplasminogen by either factor XII or a plasminogen activator (PA). Examplesof PAs include tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogenactivator, and streptokinase. Once formed, plasmin splits fibrin and alsodegrades both fibrinogen and coagulation factors VIII and V. Plasma protease inhibitors include antithrombin III and protein C. Antithrombin III inthe presence of heparin inhibits thrombin, XIIa, XIa, Xa, and IXa, while protein C inhibits Va and VIIIa. The significance of these control mechanisms isillustrated by the fact that abnormalities of these systems, such as deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S, are associated with hypercoagulable states and increased risk of thrombosis, as the main factorsleading to thrombosis include injury to endothelium, alterations in bloodflow, and hypercoagulability of the blood. Hypercoagulability may be a primary (genetic) or secondary abnormality. Primary hypercoagulable statesinclude the previously mentioned deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C,or protein S. These deficiencies are associated with recurrent thromboembolism in early adult life and recurrent spontaneous abortions in women.The causes of secondary hypercoagulable states are numerous and includesevere trauma, burns, disseminated cancer, and pregnancy. Lower risk factors for the development of secondary hypercoagulable states include age,smoking, and obesity. Some patients with high titers of autoantibodiesagainst anionic phospholipids such as cardiolipin (the antibody being called a lupus anticoagulant) have a high frequency of arterial and venous thrombosis. To summarize, it is important to remember that the differential diagnosis of recurrent spontaneous abortions in women includes deficiencies ofprotein C and protein S, and the presence of the lupus anticoagulant, whichis part of the antiphospholipid syndrome.",B,PA inhibitors,Protein C,Plasmin,Thrombin,C’1 inactivator,"B.

Review of systems is remarkable only for occasional fevers and the fact that the patient quit smoking approximately 8 months ago.  A colonoscopy is performed and reveals a granular, friable colonic mucosal surface with loss of normal vascular pattern from the anal verge to the hepatic flexure of the colon.

Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?","Oral corticosteroids are a mainstay of firstline treatment for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Starting doses of 40 mg PO daily of prednisone, with a slow taper, are often effective in  reducing colonic inflammation, although some patients are unable to wean steroids or maintain remission once achieved. The patient does not have dysplasia in any biopsy specimens, nor does he have signs of systemic toxicity, so a colectomy would be premature. Oral metronidazole is ineffective in ulcerative colitis. Cortisone enemas would be helpful if the patient had isolated left-sided disease, but it is doubtful that enema therapy would reach his hepatic flexure. Intravenous cyclosporine would be used in severe colitis as a last measure before colectomy but this patient is not yet sick enough to warrant such therapy. PSC occurs in approximately 3% of patients with ulcerative colitis and is its major liver complication. It is a chronic inflammatory condition of the biliary tree. It can typically  manifest with elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels, and results in diffuse stricturing and pruning of the biliary tree. Wilson disease, hereditary hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are not associated with ulcerative colitis and are not cholestatic liver diseases. Primary biliary cirrhosis could account for these laboratory findings, but is rare in both males and patients with ulcerative colitis.

Patients withcongenital deficiencies in the early components of the complement cascadehave recurrent symptoms resembling those of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) due to the deposition of immune complexes. Patients with deficienciesof the middle complement components (C3 and C5) are at risk for recurrentpyogenic infections, while those lacking terminal complement components(C6, C7, or C8, but not C9) are prone to developing recurrent infections withNeisseria species. A deficiency of decay accelerating factor (DAF), whichbreaks down the C3 convertase complex, is seen in paroxysmal nocturnalhemoglobinuria (PNH), a disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodesof hemolysis of red cells because of the excessive intravascular activation ofcomplement. Deficiencies of C1 esterase inhibitor result in recurrentangioedema, which refers to episodic nonpitting edema of soft tissue, such asthe face. Severe abdominal pain and cramps, occasionally accompanied byvomiting, may be caused by edema of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). To understand how a deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause vascular-produced edema(angioedema), note that not only does C1 inhibitor inactivate C1, but it alsoinhibits other pathways, such as the conversion of prekallikrein to kallikreinand kininogen to bradykinin. A deficiency of C1 inhibitor also leads to excessproduction of C2, a product of C2 called C2 kinin, and bradykinin. It is theuncontrolled activation of bradykinin that produces the angioedema, asbradykinin increases vascular permeability, stimulates smooth muscle contraction, dilates blood vessels, and causes pain.

Deep tendon reflexes at the ankle and the knee are absent bilaterally. Which of the following additional findings will support a purely sensory neuropathy over an underlying cerebellar lesion?","The inability to perform a tandem walk may be seen in ataxia due to sensory or cerebellar deficits. Additional cerebellar testing such as dysmetria, diadochokinesia, and testing for Romberg sign helps differentiate a sensory lesion from a cerebellar lesion.

The presence of Romberg's sign indicates a lesion in the sensory or vestibular pathways, as the patient is able to correct posture using vision. The inability to maintain posture, even with the use of vision, suggests a more central etiology, such as a cerebellar lesion.

The initial primary survey shows his blood pressure is 105/74 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96% at room air. On physical examination, the patient is noted to have periorbital ecchymosis with tarsal plate sparing and hemotympanum. There is also a left-sided complete facial weakness.

The most common bone involved in basilar skull fractures is the petrous portion of the temporal bone. A CT scan of the skull is most likely to show a fracture of the petrous temporal bone,

Fractures involving the petrous ridge of the temporal bone will cause blood to pool behind the tympanic membrane causing it to appear purple, which is called hemotympanum. Periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes): Pooling of blood surrounding the eyes is most commonly associated with fractures of the anterior cranial fossa.

Systemic corticosteroids are used on a short-term basis to treat exacerbations in patients with COPD but are not recommended for chronic use. It is not routinely recommended to discontinue a long-acting bronchodilator unless the patient experiences an adverse effect or experiences no therapeutic benefit. In this case, the patient reports only mild symptoms in between exacerbations, suggesting she may be benefiting from both bronchodilators.

An x-ray was done, which revealed the fracture of the humerus. On examination, he has a weakness of the right shoulder abduction and the right shoulder external rotation. However, he has good strength in the forearm and the hand muscles. Which structure is most likely affected?
Correct answer
Well done!
You answered succ","This is a classical scenario of the axillary nerve injury, which occurs most commonly due to anterior dislocation of the shoulder or fracture of the humerus.

The diagnosis is initially made on a neurological exam. The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid and the teres minor, which are responsible for shoulder abduction and external rotation, respectively.

A sensory deficit of the skin over the inferior portion of the deltoid, usually known as the regimental badge area, could be seen. Paresthesias along the route of the axillary nerve could also be reported. In long-standing cases, deltoid muscle atrophy can occur, giving the shoulder a much-flattened appearance.",A,Axillary nerve,ulnar nerve,radial nerve,median nerve,Lower brachial plexus,"A


The axillary nerve is responsible for innervating the deltoid and teres minor muscles, which are involved in shoulder abduction and external rotation. Damage to this nerve would result in weakness of these movements, as described in the patient's symptoms. The other nerves listed have different functions: the ulnar nerve affects the forearm and hand, the radial nerve affects the posterior compartment of the arm and forearm, the median nerve affects the anterior forearm and some hand muscles, and the lower brachial plexus would affect a broader area than just the shoulder abduction and external rotation.",A,0.87517655,0.86889136,0.8720226,0.3088235244387976,0.13333332834321007,0.27941175973291527,True

Lung abscesses are also common in those patients with a high risk for aspiration, seizures, bulbar dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. Lung abscess is included in infections such as necrotizing pneumonia and lung gangrene, which is characterized by multiple abscesses.

Patients with alcohol use disorder are more prone to develop lung abscesses due to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions.

mental status over the past several months. Her vision is normal. A CT scan reveals
hydrocephalus, but the lumbar puncture pressure is unexpectedly low. What does she
have?


","The correct answer is B. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an increase in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain's ventricles, leading to hydrocephalus. However, unlike other forms of hydrocephalus, the pressure of CSF within the ventricles remains within the normal range.

The classic triad of symptoms in NPH includes gait disturbance (imbalance), cognitive impairment (deterioration of mental status), and urinary incontinence. Vision is typically not affected in NPH.

The unexpected finding of low lumbar puncture pressure in the context of hydrocephalus is consistent with NPH. In NPH, the pressure of CSF in the ventricles may be elevated, but the pressure in the lumbar subarachnoid space, where the lumbar puncture is performed, may be normal or low.

The other options listed are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings:

A. Meningitis: Meningitis typically presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and often, altered mental status. However, it is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

C. Sigmoid sinus thrombosis: Sigmoid sinus thrombosis typically presents with headache, ear pain, and sometimes, focal neurological deficits. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

D. Echinococcus: Echinococcus infection (hydatid disease) typically presents with cystic lesions in various organs, depending on where the larvae settle. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

E. Glioblastoma multiforme: Glioblastoma multiforme is a type of brain tumor that typically presents with focal neurological deficits, seizures, and sometimes, raised intracranial pressure. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

The symptoms of dyspnoea on exertion and orthopnoea, along with the physical examination findings of a loud first heart sound, a diastolic rumble, and a large v wave in the jugular pulse, are classic for mitral stenosis. The large v wave is indicative of increased left atrial pressure, which is consistent with mitral stenosis. Additionally, the presence of a diastolic rumble suggests mitral stenosis, as this is a sound associated with the turbulent flow across the stenotic mitral valve during diastole. The loud first heart sound could also be associated with tricuspid regurgitation, which can occur secondary to the elevated right atrial pressures seen in mitral stenosis.

Which of the following would you expect to see in this patient?,"When cardiac output is reduced, the body compensates by diverting more cardiac output to the cerebral circulation. A greater proportion of the IV anesthetic enters the cerebral circulation under these circumstances. Therefore, the dose of the IV drug must be reduced (not increased). Also, with reduced cardiac output, it takes a longer time for an IV induction drug to reach the brain, resulting in a slower induction time.

This would be seen in a patient, such as an amateur spelunker, who has been in a cave with bats. It is the act of crawling through the cave that disturbs the spores of histoplasmosis that grow in the bat guano. The incubation period for influenza is 1–2 days. It is passed primarily by secretions from the nose spread by hands. The other members of the expedition were not sick, as they might be with influenza. Disseminated aspergillosis occurs in immunocompromised patients who have defects in both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. This patient does not have this. While the CXR could mimic miliary tuberculosis, the association with caving 14 days before would make tuberculosis less likely and histoplasmosis more likely. There is no history that the patient is immunocompromised with HIV and would be at risk for P. jiroveci pneumonia. Fungal serologies would establish the diagnosis, but acute and convalescent serologies would take 3 weeks for results. These are only useful in outbreak investigations.

If NSAIDs do not resolve symptoms, therapy would be escalated to include methotrexate and one other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), such as sulfasalazine plus a steroid (D). DMARDs should be offered early within the treatment of the disease to limit joint destruction. Short-term steroid therapy is useful for controlling disease flares and can be given by oral, intramuscular and intra-articular routes. Intramuscular depot injection of methylprednisolone plus NSAIDs (B) will be very useful in managing symptoms of the flare, but will not alter the disease course. Anti-TNF therapy (C) is reserved for patients who have active disease despite DMARDs (usually two trials of DMARDs should be tried before considering anti-TNF).

The patient also complains of tiredness and feeling short of breath after climbing a few steps. Physical examination shows increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, and pedal edema. The provider prescribed a medication that is known to increase intracellular calcium levels and has a positive ionotropic effect on the heart. What is the mechanism of action of the drug prescribed by the provider?","Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase (Na-K ATPase) pump, which is an enzyme that is needed for the active transport of sodium outside and potassium inside the myocardial cell membrane. This creates a transmembranous gradient, which is used by Na-Ca (sodium-calcium) antiporter. Inhibiting Na-K ATPase leads to increased intracellular sodium; this, in turn, decreases the function of the sodium antiporter that brings sodium ions inside the cell and exports calcium outside the cell. Decreased transmembrane gradient decreases the activity of the Na-Ca antiporter, thus increasing intracellular Ca, which also leads to Ca-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Increased intracellular calcium results in an increased force of contraction. Intracellular calcium leads to the prolongation of phases 4 and 0 of the cardiac action potential. It also acts on the atrioventricular node by increasing the parasympathetic tone mediated by the vagus nerve, therefore decreasing the heart rate.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of digoxin include increased PR interval, decreased QT interval, and inversion of the T wave.

Digoxin causes minimal vasodilation due to decreased sympathetic discharge.",D,Decreasing conduction at the sino-atrial node,Blocking calcium channels,Blocking beta receptors,Inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase (Sodium-Potassium ATPase) pump,Blocking alpha receptors,"B

The description of the patient's symptoms and the effects of the medication suggest that the drug is likely a positive inotrope, which increases the force of heart contractions. Positive inotropes often work by increasing intracellular calcium levels, which enhances cardiac muscle contraction.

The laboratory findings of hypokalemia, hyperchloremia, and normal anion gap acidosis along with normal stool osmolar gap make the diagnosis of secretory diarrhea. The presence of a solitary pancreatic lesion indicates the presence of pancreatic VIPoma. Somatostatin analogs are useful for the management of VIPoma.

VIPomas are functional neuroendocrine tumors that secrete vasoactive intestinal peptide. The signs and symptoms are due to hormonal activation. Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide and lanreotide are highly effective in controlling diarrhea in VIPoma.

The initial dose of octreotide is 50-100 mcg subcutaneously every 8 hours, followed by titration as required. Monthy depot intramuscular formulations are available once symptom control is adequate.

Octreotide is usually well tolerated but can have some important side effects such as gall bladder hypomotility. Treatment with glucocorticoids can be considered in individuals with resistant diarrhea. Clonidine is useful in diarrhea associated with diabetic autonomic enteropathy, which is unlikely given the good glycemic control.

Vital signs show a blood pressure of 210/120 mmHg. On examination, she is noted to have some digital nail pitting and bilateral papilledema. No abdominal bruit is present. Laboratory values are significant for thrombocytopenia, normocytic anemia, increased indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, elevated LDH, BUN 23 mg/dl, serum creatinine 3 mg/dl, and glucose 112 mg/dl. Urine analysis shows mild proteinuria. The patient has no known kidney disease, no history of hypertension and laboratory values from 6 months ago were all within normal limits. On further questioning her medical history, she states that she had some recent onset of heartburn for which she has been taking omeprazole. Which of the following is the most likely cause for her sudden increase in blood pressure?","Given the patient's young age and acute change in her blood pressure, a secondary cause of hypertension has to be considered. The presence of the Raynaud phenomenon, nail pitting on the exam, and heartburn (which may be suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease) are clues that the patient may have underlying systemic sclerosis.

Systemic sclerosis is characterized by abnormal deposition of collagenous material in multiple organ systems. Collagenous deposition can cause thickening of the wall of blood vessels, which in turn causes narrowing of the vascular lumen and the renal arterioles, resulting in hypertension and ischemia, leading to scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). SRC develops in about 5 to 20% of systemic sclerosis patients and is characterized by a sudden onset of hypertension (blood pressure greater than 150/85 mmHg) and a progressive decline in renal function. It may also be characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy, acute retinal changes of malignant hypertension, and new-onset proteinuria or hematuria, as seen in this case. Also, this patient is on chronic steroids, which is an added risk factor for the development of SRC. Other risk factors for SRC include the presence of autoantibodies against RNA polymerase, early-stage disease with diffuse skin involvement, palpable tendon friction rubs on examination, and cyclosporine use.

To confirm the diagnosis, serological tests can be used: autoantibodies against RNA polymerase III or a fine-speckled immunofluorescence pattern on ANA testing. SRC is managed with ACE inhibitors (viz: captopril).

Pheochromocytoma is characterized by episodic tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, and headache. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is primarily seen in children. Sudden onset renal failure is present but usually has a preceding history of diarrhea and has predominant hematological symptoms like thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Also, this patient has other clinical features suggestive of scleroderma (e.g., nail pitting, GERD, Raynaud phenomenon).

Her neurological examination reveals decreased hearing in her right ear, but a symmetrical face and no other cranial nerve deficits. A Rinne test is performed, which is abnormal in the right ear. Sound lateralizes to the right ear on the Weber test. Which of the following structures is most likely affected in the pathophysiology of this disease process?","This patient who presents with right-sided hearing loss, with an abnormal Rinne test in her right ear and a Weber test that lateralizes sound to that same ear, is most likely suffering from right-sided conductive hearing loss.

Conductive hearing loss can be caused by pathology in the ear canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear, or oval window.

The stapes is a structure in the ossicular chain that is responsible for transmitting vibrational energy through the oval window in order to allow sound perception. It can be affected in conductive hearing loss, particularly in conditions such as otosclerosis, which this patient most likely has.

The tympanic membrane is also a structure that can be implicated in conductive hearing loss but is less likely the source of pathology in this patient with no otalgia and normal appearing intact tympanic membranes.

They may be confused with deep venous thrombosis, and ultrasound will be helpful to differentiate. Appropriate initial management is NSAIDs and RICE therapy. Baker cysts are common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

This patient should be referred to rheumatology as she has symptoms consistent with intermittent rheumatoid flares. Only about 60 to 80° of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a positive rheumatoid factor. An ANA should be ordered to assess for other connective tissue diseases.

While an Ewing sarcoma or enlarged lymph nodes are within the differential diagnosis for this patient, she does not describe symptoms that are consistent with cancer.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of polyarthropathy, particularly affecting the neck and hands, along with the presence of a cystic lesion involving a joint space, raise concern for a neoplastic process.

Rationale: Plasmodium falciparum is known for causing severe malaria, which includes cerebral malaria where the parasitized red blood cells (RBCs) adhere to the walls of blood vessels in the brain, leading to obstruction and complications such as high fever and convulsions.

B. Thick smear was used to identify species - This is incorrect because thick smears are used for detecting the presence of parasites, but for species identification, a thin smear is typically used.

C. Hyperglycemia is a known complication - This is incorrect. Hyperglycemia is not a typical complication of malaria; instead, hypoglycemia, especially in children, can be a concern.

D. Microcytic anemia is evident in Peripheral blood film - This is incorrect. The anemia associated with malaria is typically normocytic, not microcytic.

Increasing the sample size in a study generally increases the power of the study, which reduces the chance of a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). However, the question specifically asks about the effect of increasing the sample size on the incidence of Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis). In this context, a larger sample size does not inherently increase the chance of a Type I error; it can actually decrease it because the results are more likely to be statistically significant if there is a true effect. However, since the options provided do not include a decrease in Type I error, and the closest related option is ""Greater chance of a Type I error,"" it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing.

She has failed multiple SSRIs, SNRI, and bupropion. She is prescribed a medication that requires the dietary restriction of tyramine-containing foods due to the potential for a life-threatening side effect. Which of the following medications is most likely to cause a life-threatening reaction with this medication?","Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were first introduced in the 1950s. They are a separate class from other antidepressants, treating different forms of depression as well as other nervous system disorders such as panic disorder, social phobia, and depression with atypical features. Examples of atypical features are oversleeping and overeating. Even though MAOIs were the first antidepressants introduced, they are not the first choice in treating mental health disorders due to several dietary restrictions, side effects, and safety concerns. MAOIs are only a treatment option when all other medications are unsuccessful.

MAOIs prevent the breakdown of tyramine found in the body and certain foods, drinks, and other medications. Patients who take MAOIs and consume tyramine-containing foods or beverages will exhibit high serum tyramine levels. A high level of tyramine can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure, called the tyramine pressor response. Even though it is rare, a high tyramine level can trigger a cerebral hemorrhage, which can even result in death.

Tramadol, meperidine, dextromethorphan, and methadone are contraindicated in patients on MAOIs as they are at high risk for causing serotonin syndrome.

SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, bupropion, mirtazapine, St. John's wort, and sympathomimetic amines, including stimulants, are contraindicated with MAOIs. However, coadministration of MAOIs with lithium, valproic acid, or topiramate is generally considered safe.",B,Lithium,Meperidine,Valproic acid,Topiramate,None of the above,"B


Rationale: Meperidine is an opioid that can displace monoamine neurotransmitters from their storage sites, leading to a potentially life-threatening increase in serotonin levels, especially when combined with other serotonergic drugs. This can cause serotonin syndrome, which is characterized by symptoms such as high body temperature, agitation, increased reflexes, tremor, sweating, dilated pupils, and diarrhea.

Rationale: The presence of a penis and XX chromosomes suggests female genetic makeup, but the development of male external genitalia (penis and scrotum) and the absence of a vagina and testes indicate exposure to male hormones (testosterone) during critical periods of fetal development.

His abdominal examination is normal.  The presence of which of the following findings is a clinical predictor for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis?","Pharyngitis is a commonly encountered problem in primary care. Patients with upper respiratory symptoms are often convinced that they need antibiotics. Often the etiology is viral, but ruling out bacterial etiology is crucial as the secondary complications can be severe. In terms of group A strep pharyngitis, it is often difficult to make a clinical diagnosis based on one or two factors. Many studies have been performed to guide the clinician in making an empiric diagnosis of group A strep pharyngitis. Fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, absence of cough and tonsillar hypertrophy are all positive predictors. A patient who has at least two of these criteria should have a rapid strep test or culture—with treatment initiated if the test is positive. When a patient meets three or more criteria and is ill appearing, empiric treatment may be justified. If the patient has a negative rapid strep test and the clinician is suspicious, empiric treatment may be started and throat culture should be obtained. Apatient with a positive culture or rapid strep test should be treated, but a test of cure does not need to be performed. The throat culture has a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99%, while the rapid strep test has a sensitivity of 80–97% and a specificity of >95%. (Am Fam Physician 2004;69(6): 1465–1470) The first-line medication for patients diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin.

Rationale: Streptococcal pharyngitis, also known as strep throat, is best diagnosed by the presence of certain clinical features. Among the options provided, tonsillar exudates are a classic sign associated with streptococcal infection. While erythematous tonsils can be seen in many throat infections, they are not specific to streptococcal pharyngitis. Cough is more commonly associated with respiratory infections and is not specific to strep throat.

Spinal stenosis may be difficult to distinguish from claudication; however, spinal stenosis usually has neurologic deficits, and peripheral pulses are normal.

MRI scanning, with its multiplanar-imaging capability, is currently the preferred modality for establishing a diagnosis and excluding other conditions.

The patient reports a history of two previous cesarean sections, and she also reports that the provider was unable to remove her placenta during her last delivery. She was given medication after the procedure that caused severe nausea and vomiting. Which of the following medications could be used during the cesarean section to reduce the risk of blood loss?","Placenta accreta spectrum disorders describe a group of disorders in which the placenta invades the myometrium of the uterus. While diagnosis before delivery is preferred, it can be diagnosed at the time of delivery when the placenta is not delivered completely. Prior cesarean sections increase the risk of this disorder.

The current recommendation for treatment is cesarean hysterectomy. However, in patients wishing to preserve fertility with placenta accreta, the entire placenta or portion of the placenta can be left in situ. Some providers prescribe methotrexate after delivery to help with placental involution in cases of placenta previa. Nausea and vomiting are the most common adverse effects of methotrexate. Tranexamic acid is a very effective medication that could be used during the cesarean section to reduce the risk of intraoperative blood loss.

Rationale: Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that helps reduce bleeding by preventing the breakdown of blood clots. This can be particularly useful during a cesarean section to reduce the risk of blood loss, especially in a patient with a history of difficult placental separation. Prostaglandin-F2 alpha and Prostaglandin E2 are not used for this purpose; they are involved in labor induction and other processes. Carbetocin is an oxytocin analog used to prevent postpartum hemorrhage but not typically used during cesarean sections.

Which one of the following diagnostic images is APPROPRIATE in this subject?","Traditionally, the standard workup for patients with renal colic involved a kidney-ureter-bladder X-ray (KUB), renal ultrasound, and intravenous urography (IVU). However, KUB has limitations in detecting radiolucent stones like uric acid stones. Ultrasound can visualize hydronephrosis in the obstructed kidney and the stone itself, but it's less accurate in determining stone size and detecting ureteral stones. IVU is used to confirm kidney obstruction by showing prolonged nephrogram phase, delayed contrast excretion, and dilation of the pelvicalyceal system and ureter. 

Recent studies have shifted towards using unenhanced CT scans as the initial choice due to their high sensitivity in detecting hydronephrosis, renal, and ureteral stones, regardless of size or composition. Unenhanced CT scans also offer advantages such as shorter examination time, greater diagnostic accuracy, and the ability to detect extrarenal conditions like appendicitis or diverticulitis. Additionally, they are cost-effective compared to IVU, though they do involve higher radiation dosage.

Which of the following hemolytic anemias can be classified as extracorpuscular?,"Hemolytic anemias are categorized as either intracorpuscular or extracorpuscular. In intracorpuscular disorders, the patient's red blood cells (RBCs) have a shortened lifespan due to an intrinsic factor within the RBC itself. Conversely, extracorpuscular disorders result in a shortened RBC lifespan due to factors external to the RBC.Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acquired disorder characterized by microangiopathy-induced destruction of RBCs and platelets due to destructive shear forces. Symptoms may include fever, mental status changes, and renal impairment. Most acquired adult cases of TTP involve autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS-13. Evaluation for schistocytes in a peripheral smear is crucial for ruling out TTP, as plasmapheresis is lifesaving.Other causes of extravascular hemolytic anemia encompass hypersplenism, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.The remaining disorders listed entail defects within the RBC itself leading to hemolysis:- Elliptocytosis: a membranopathy resulting in varying degrees of RBC destruction within the reticuloendothelial system.- Sickle cell anemia: a congenital hemoglobinopathy characterized by recurrent pain crises and long-term sequelae, stemming from a well-defined β-globin mutation.- Pyruvate kinase deficiency: a rare disorder of the glycolytic pathway causing hemolytic anemia.- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): an acquired hemolysis due to an intrinsic abnormality of RBCs, often accompanied by thrombosis and cytopenias, with bone marrow failure as a serious complication.",D,Elliptocytosis.,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.,Pyruvate kinase deficiency.,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura.,Sickle cell anemia,"B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

Rationale: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). It is caused by a mutation in a gene that affects the blood cells' ability to protect themselves from the complement system, which is part of the immune system. This destruction occurs outside the red blood cells (extracorpuscular), unlike the other conditions listed which are primarily intracorpuscular (within the red blood cells).",B,0.8680433,0.80410105,0.8348496,0.21782177830751895,0.05970148867787951,0.19801979810949913,False

She has a history of sickle cell disease and reports experiencing frequent pain crises. What is the most appropriate anesthetic technique?,"In this scenario, a combined spinal-epidural anesthesia would be the most appropriate technique. Spinal anesthesia would provide rapid onset and dense neuraxial blockade for the cesarean section, while the epidural component allows for continuous postoperative analgesia, which is particularly important for this patient with sickle cell disease, who may experience painful crises.

The etiology of SCC in urogenital schistosomiasis is multifactorial. It includes chronic irritation and inflammation from schistosome egg deposition, causing a granulomatous reaction. Over time, restorative hyperplasia can also lead to cellular damage, with an overall increase in the possibility of malignancy.

The schistosome life cycle is complex. Intermediate hosts are Bulinus snails, which are endemic to parts of Africa and the Middle East.

His physician orders a complete blood count (CBC), which reveals a decrease in hemoglobin of 7.5 mg/dL and hematocrit of 22%. The patient is suspected of a vitamin deficiency, which is confirmed by a peripheral blood smear that shows hypersegmented neutrophils, with a portion of the neutrophils having greater than or equal to 5 lobes. What type of anemia does this patient most likely have?","This patient likely has a vitamin B12 deficiency due to chronic inflammation in the terminal ileum due to his history of celiac disease.

Vitamin B12 binds to a glycoprotein known as intrinsic factor, which is produced by parietal cells in the stomach. The complex is subsequently absorbed in the terminal ileum.

Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor for the synthesis of myelin and can lead to a condition known as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord when deficient. As a result, patients may present with neurological findings, such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathy.

Vitamin B12 plays an essential role in the synthesis of DNA, and deficiency can lead to macrocytic anemia. A complete blood count (CBC) would reveal a decrease in hemoglobin, a decrease in hematocrit, and an increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

The drug added to decrease the toxicity of methotrexate to normal cells is likely a leucovorin (folinic acid) rescue agent, which bypasses the need for dihydrofolate reductase by providing a form of folate that can be used directly in the synthesis of thymidylate and purines, thus sparing normal cells from the toxic effects of methotrexate.",A,0.9041347,0.9017494,0.90294045,0.533333328336889,0.31313130813335377,0.5066666616702222,True

However, several other prognostic factors also influence survival outcomes and guide treatment decisions. Tumors lacking estrogen or progesterone receptors tend to have a higher likelihood of recurrence. Conversely, the presence of estrogen receptors, especially in postmenopausal women, plays a crucial role in determining the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumors characterized by a high growth rate are associated with early relapse, and the measurement of the proportion of cells in the S-phase serves as an indicator of growth rate. Tumors with a higher number of cells in the S-phase than the median value are at increased risk of relapse but may also demonstrate a better response to chemotherapy.Histologically, tumors with a poor nuclear grade carry a higher risk of recurrence compared to those with a favorable nuclear grade. Furthermore, at the molecular level, tumors overexpressing erbB2 (HER-2/neu) or harboring a mutated p53 gene are indicative of a poorer prognosis for patients. The overexpression of erbB2 also aids in tailoring optimal treatment regimens, with the development of a human monoclonal antibody targeting erbB2 (Herceptin) being a notable advancement in this regard.",D,Estrogen receptor positive,Good nuclear grade,Low proportion of cells in S-phase,Overexpression of erbB2 (HER-2/neu),Progesterone receptor positive,"D. Overexpression of erbB2 (HER-2/neu)

Rationale: Overexpression of the HER-2/neu gene is associated with a more aggressive form of breast cancer and is linked to a poorer prognosis. This characteristic often indicates a higher likelihood of recurrence and a lower response to certain types of chemotherapy, making it a significant factor in determining the prognosis of breast cancer patients.",D,0.8799213,0.83730394,0.8580837,0.24390243521415828,0.1201716702131188,0.2317073132629388,True

Exacerbation of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is characterized by a 100% increase in serum IgE levels from the baseline established after responding to treatment or remission.

Some exacerbations may be asymptomatic and can only be detected radiographically and serologically. That's why it is recommended to measure serum IgE every 1 month after an exacerbation (vs. every 3 months during remission) to detect asymptomatic remissions because if left untreated, it can result in lung damage.

Management of an exacerbation includes increasing the dose of the oral steroids back to the response dose and adding an anti-fungal medication to the regimen.

","To calculate the maintenance daily fluid requirement for a child, a commonly used formula is the Holliday-Segar method, which recommends 100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg of body weight, 50 mL/kg for the next 10 kg, and 20 mL/kg for every kg thereafter.

For a 22-kg infant:

The first 10 kg would require 100 mL/kg * 10 kg = 1000 mL.
The next 10 kg would require 50 mL/kg * 10 kg = 500 mL.
The remaining 2 kg would require 20 mL/kg * 2 kg = 40 mL.

50f4c0ec451618155bdfa05ed21d75515bde46a84dec64226799ffd1dd5b1827,"A 50-year-old man presents in respiratory distress and is admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation. The patient's ideal body weight is 156 lb (71 kg), and the ventilator is set to a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg. His end-tidal CO2 is 25 mmHg, and his arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide is 50 mmHg. What is the approximate physiologic dead space in this patient?","The normal adult tidal volume is 500 mL. When intubated on a ventilator, the tidal volume is set by the machine parameters. In this case, the tidal volume is 71 kg x 6 mL/kg = 426 mL.

The formula for physiologic dead space is Vd = Vt (PaCO2 - PeCO2 / PaCO2). Vd = dead space, Vt = tidal volume, PaCO2 is partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and PeCO2 is partial pressure of mean expired CO2.

A mnemonic to remember the formula is dead space equals ""Taco, PaCO, PeCO, PaCO.""

Vd = Vt (PaCO2 - PeCO2 / PaCO2): 426 mL x (50 mmHg - 25 mmHg)/50 mmHg = 213 mL which is closest to 200 mL in the answer choices.",B,150 mL,200 mL,250 mL,300 mL,350 mL,"D. 300 mL

Rationale: The physiologic dead space can be estimated using the Bohr equation:

Vd/Vt = (PaCO2 - PeCO2) / PaCO2

Where Vd is the dead space volume, Vt is the tidal volume, PaCO2 is the arterial partial pressure of CO2, and PeCO2 is the end-tidal CO2.

First, we need to convert the tidal volume (Vt) from mL/kg to mL. The patient's ideal body weight is 71 kg, so:

Vt = 6 mL/kg * 71 kg = 426 mL

Now we can plug in the values into the Bohr equation:

Vd/Vt = (50 mmHg - 25 mmHg) / 50 mmHg = 25 / 50 = 0.5

To find the dead space volume (Vd), we multiply the ratio by the tidal volume:

Vd = 0.5 * 426 mL = 213 mL

The closest answer to 213 mL is 200 mL, but since this is not an option and the actual calculated value is closer to 300 mL, it seems there might be a mistake in the provided options. However, based on the closest available option, the answer would be:

The weight of baby Binta on the 4th day will be calculated as follows:Birth weight (4.4kg) minus 10% of the birth weight10% of 4.4kg= 0.44kg4.4kg-0.44kg= 3.96kg,C,3.9kg,2.96kg,3.96kg,3.66kg,4.0kg,"B. 2.96kg

Rationale: To find the baby's weight after losing 10%, we calculate 10% of the birth weight (4.4kg) and subtract it from the birth weight. 10% of 4.4kg is 0.44kg. So, 4.4kg - 0.44kg = 3.96kg. However, there seems to be a mistake in the options provided. The correct calculation should be 4.4kg - (10% of 4.4kg) = 4.4kg - 0.44kg = 3.96kg.

A physical exam reveals a globular abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, and a 1 cm defect in her umbilical area. Which of the following pathology is associated with this condition?","During fetal development, the primitive umbilical ring appears as early as 4th week of gestation on the ventral surface of the body. It contains umbilical vessels (one vein and two arteries), allantois, vitelline duct, vitelline vessels and loop of midgut. As the herniated midgut reduces, the definitive umbilical cord will develop containing the umbilical vessels surrounded by Wharton's jelly.

The umbilical vessels obliterate after birth and will be replaced by a ligamentous structure. Congenital disorders of the umbilicus include umbilical hernia, patent urachus, omphalomesenteric fistula, and umbilical polyp. It is important to recognize these defects as early as possible is essential to prevent complications.

A persistent omphalomesenteric duct is associated with an umbilical fistula, sinus, or polyp. Omphalocele is a central abdominal wall defect with an absent umbilicus. A persistent urachus is associated with an umbilical fistula, sinus, or polyp.

Failure of obliteration of the umbilical ring after separation of the umbilical cord predisposes to the development of an umbilical hernia.

The colposcope provides a view at 10 to 16 times magnification. Pap smear is a cytological screening test for cervical neoplasms. A Pap smear result indicating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) may indicate moderate or severe cervical dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.During colposcopy, 3% acetic acid is applied to the cervix, which helps visualize abnormal blood vessels or acetowhite areas indicating dysplasia. Any abnormal areas observed are biopsied for histologic analysis. Patients with an HGSIL Pap smear result do not require repeat testing or HPV testing, as the cytological findings suggest cervical neoplasia. Repeat Pap smear testing could yield false-negative results, delaying necessary treatment. Random cervical biopsies are not recommended as they may miss the actual abnormal tissue.Indications for a cone biopsy include unsatisfactory colposcopic examination, a colposcopically directed biopsy indicating possible invasive disease, neoplasm in the endocervix, or discrepancies between cervical biopsy results and Pap smear findings.

Barbiturates are known to precipitate a porphyria attack and should be avoided.

Intravenous infusion of heme is considered the first-line treatment for an acute attack. Beta-blockers are indicated for the treatment of sympathetic stimulation from a painful attack.

The patient has been taking diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, which has anticholinergic (anti-muscarinic) effects. These antihistamines are designed to relieve allergic symptoms caused by the release of histamine from mast cells. However, they can also block other receptors, including cholinergic receptors.The ciliary muscle in the eye, which controls the shape of the lens and thus our ability to focus on near or far objects (a process known as accommodation), is under parasympathetic control from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus/ciliary ganglion. This pathway is inhibited by antimuscarinic agents like diphenhydramine, leading to impaired accommodation and blurred vision when trying to focus on close objects.In addition to this, patients on antimuscarinic agents may also experience mydriasis (pupillary dilation) due to the inhibition of the pupillary sphincter, which also receives parasympathetic innervation from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus.",A,Acetylcholine,Histamine,Leukotrienes,Norepinephrine,Serotonin,"B.

Pretreatment with low-dose dexamethasone (before DEC therapy) prevents the development of the Mazzotti reaction and dramatically reduces the microfilaricidal activity of DEC. However use of diphenhydramine, after the onset of the Mazzotti reaction, had no effect on the course and intensity of the Mazzotti reaction nor microfilaricidal activity.

Desmopressin is considered a contraindication in von Willebrand Type 2b because it enhances and increases the number of glycoprotein complexes, promoting platelet aggregation leading to clinically significant thrombocytopenia with an increased risk of spontaneous bleeding. Desmopressin should not be given to patients with this subtype.

Clinical examination during an acute attack shows high-frequency wheezes. Bronchoconstriction due to tissue inflammation, edema, and mucous oversecretion is the cause of the disease's signs and symptoms.

Treatments for asthma are given to reduce inflammation and increase bronchial patency by relaxation of airway smooth muscles. Albuterol is a commonly prescribed drug for asthma. It targets beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which when activated, cause smooth muscle relaxation.

The theorybehind this advice is that aspirin decreases the formation of thrombiwithin the coronary arteries by inhibiting the platelet formation of whichsubstance?,"The contrasting actionsof the arachidonic acid metabolites prostacyclin and thromboxane produce afine-tuned balance for the regulation of clotting. Thromboxane, a product ofthe cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, is synthesizedin platelets and is a powerful platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor. Theprostaglandin prostacyclin, also a product of the cyclooxygenase pathwaybut produced by endothelial cells, inhibits platelet aggregation and causesvasodilation. Aspirin is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor that blocks the synthesisof both thromboxane and prostacyclin. The inhibition of prostacyclin production within endothelial cells, however, can be somewhat overcome, butnot the production of thromboxane within platelets. That is, aspirin wil selectively inhibit the production of thromboxane more than prostacyclin,which is the reason why it can be used to prevent thrombosis in patients withcoronary artery disease.In addition to producing prostacyclin, endothelial cells produce othersubstances with anticoagulant activities, such as thrombomodulin and plasminogen activator. Endothelial cells, however, produce both procoagulantand anticoagulant substances. Examples of procoagulant substances produced by endothelial cells include tissue factor (thromboplastin), which canactivate the extrinsic coagulation cascade, von Willebrand factor, and plateletactivating factor, both of which stimulate platelet aggregation. Finally fibrinogen, which is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin, is produced by the liver andnot endothelial cells or platelets.",E,Fibrinogen,Prostacyclin,Thrombomodulin,Thromboplastin,Thromboxane,"E.

Children have less creeping substitution than adults.Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is a condition that occurs when the blood supply to the femoral head is disrupted, leading to bone death and collapse. The histological features of AVN can differ between children and adults due to differences in bone remodeling and repair processes.Children have a more active bone remodeling process compared to adults, which means that they have a greater capacity for repair and regeneration. In children with AVN, there is typically more creeping substitution (the process of new bone formation replacing necrotic bone) compared to adults. However, despite this increased capacity for repair, children may still experience osseous collapse and residual changes after 2 years.Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:e. Children have less creeping substitution than adults.",E,Large areas of fibrovascular tissue do not form in children.,There is no osteoclastic resorption in children.,Children do not have any residual changes after 2 years.,Children do not demonstrate osseous collapse.,Children have less creeping substitution than adults.,"E. Children have less creeping substitution than adults.

The main causes include iodine deficiency, autoimmune pathology such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and, in females who have recently given birth, postpartum thyroiditis. Hyperthryoidism (C) results in an excess of thyroid hormones which inappropriately increases metabolic rate with symptoms such as weight loss, increased sweating, restlessness and palpitations. A goitre can occur in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Postpartum depression (A) is often accompanied by confusion and is characterized by low mood, anhedonia and anergia. Severely affected patients can have delusional thoughts about their newborn child, such as it being evil, and even progress to thoughts of harming the child or suicidal ideation.

Liquefactive necrosis is the type of necrosis produced by acute bacterial infections. With liquefactive necrosis the dead cells are completely dissolved byhydrolytic enzymes from acute inflammatory cells and all that remains is aliquid mass. Liquefactive necrosis can also be seen with fungal infections,and it is the type of necrosis that is produced by ischemic necrosis of thebrain. More commonly, however, ischemia produces coagulative necrosis,which is characterized by loss of the cell nucleus, acidophilic change of thecytoplasm, and preservation of the outline of the cell. Sudden, severeischemia produces coagulative necrosis in practically every tissue exceptthe brain. Myocardial infarction, which results from the sudden occlusionof the coronary artery, is a classic example of coagulative necrosis. Caseous necrosis is a combination of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis, but the necrotic cells are not totally dissolved and remain as amorphic,coarsely granular, eosinophilic debris. This type of necrosis grossly has theappearance of clumped cheese. It is classically seen in tuberculous infections.Gangrenous necrosis of extremities is also a combination of coagulative andliquefactive necrosis. In dry gangrene the coagulative pattern is predominate,while in wet gangrene the liquefactive pattern is predominate. Fat necrosis,seen with acute pancreatic necrosis, is fat cell death caused by lipases.

What is the best initial therapy for the patient's underlying disorder?","This patient is likely presenting with pheochromocytoma, an adrenal gland tumor. These tumors arise from chromaffin cells (neural crest derivative). ~90% of these tumors are located in the adrenal medulla and are activated by acetylcholine.

This patient's family history, along with the patient's body habitus, raises suspicion for MEN2B.

The clinical presentation of a patient with pheochromocytoma is related to fluctuating levels of excess norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. It includes the following: paroxysmal, throbbing headache episodic hypertension (or persistent hypertension in some cases), palpitations, tachycardia, and diaphoresis.

The most likely diagnosis is?","Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings described, the most likely diagnosis is essential thrombocythemia (ET).Essential thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the bone marrow, leading to thrombocytosis. Patients with ET may present with symptoms related to thrombosis or bleeding, as well as symptoms related to the underlying disease process. In this case, the patient presents with severe arterial insufficiency of the right second toe, which could be attributed to thrombosis associated with elevated platelet counts.The laboratory findings of elevated platelet count (1300 x 10^9/L) support the diagnosis of ET. Additionally, the absence of significant past medical history and the presence of splenomegaly are consistent with ET.Other differential diagnoses may include polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), but the normal hemoglobin level (Hb of 13.5) and absence of erythrocytosis make PRV less likely.

Elevation in serum lipase or amylase to three times or greater than the upper limit of normal is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pathophysiology of pancreatitis involves both the localized destruction in the pancreas and systemic inflammatory response.

Conjunctival pallor is absent. Clear vesicular breath sounds are noted on auscultation with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. CO-oximeter reveals a carboxyhemoglobin of 15%, while his oxygen saturation on room air is 97%. Which of the following treatment options should be given to the patient?","This patient has carbon monoxide poisoning secondary to his prolonged exposure to this substance through the heating system in his room. Carbon monoxide binds on complex IV of the electron transport chain which aids in oxidative phosphorylation. Other sources of carbon monoxide poisoning include wood-burning, exhaust fumes, methylene chloride from paint thinners, and building fires. However, cyanide poisoning can also occur from building fires, it is advisable to exercise caution when establishing the diagnosis of such patients.

The inhibition of this complex leads to a decrease in ATP production. Other mechanisms include the binding of carbon monoxide to hemoglobin, which increases the affinity of oxygen to the remaining sites (hemoglobin acts as a tetramer). As a result, oxygen delivery to tissues is decreased, and the oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left.

Clinically, patients may present with dizziness, nausea, confusion, headache, mild chest pain, shortness of breath, seizure, poor balance, cardiac arrhythmia, and can even result in death.

Topical, oral, or intravenous carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetazolamide), topical beta-blockers (timolol), cholinergic parasympathomimetics (pilocarpine), topical alpha-agonists (brimonidine, apraclonidine), and intravenous mannitol are treatment options to acutely lower the intraocular pressure. Oral beta-blocker medications have minimal effect on intraocular pressure acutely.

Timolol and pilocarpine eye drops, and oral acetazolamide

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and signs are indicative of acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a medical emergency. The best initial treatment is to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) quickly. Timolol (a beta-blocker) and pilocarpine (a miotic agent) are used to decrease IOP by reducing aqueous humor production and opening the blocked drainage angle, respectively. Oral acetazolamide is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that also decreases aqueous humor production. The other options are either not first-line treatments for acute angle-closure glaucoma or are not appropriate for the immediate management of this condition.",A,0.860116,0.83194673,0.8457969,0.2783505107700075,0.09677418882186548,0.24742267571846113,True

He has attended the practice multiple times in the last few years for similar problems, particularly in winter. He explains he normally coughs a lot, bringing up a small amount of white sputum but currently is much more SOB and producing large volumes of green sputum. He is an ex-smoker with a 20 pack year history, and used to work as a pub landlord. His GP treats him with a course of antibiotics for a chest infection, which is very effective. She also refers him for pulmonary functions tests (PFTs) given the recurrent nature of his symptoms.

The pain has been occurring intermittently for 3 days. It is not associated with exertion, does not radiate, and is ""dull"" in nature. The physical exam is remarkable for obesity and lower extremity edema. The cardiac exam is normal. Your senior registrar asked you to perfrom an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed a left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient has had several prior ECGs in the past as seen in the documentation in his hospital folder. They all showed LBBB similar to the present one. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","The patient's left bundle branch block (LBBB) is not new; therefore, it is not an ST-segment elevation equivalent. ECGs showing LBBB do not have interpretable ST-T wave segments and there is no mention in this case regarding any positive Sgarbossa criteria.

LBBB, once present, is usually permanent. This patient has proven as much with his prior ECGs all showing LBBB. There is no clinical maneuver that can reverse LBBB.

There is no medical therapy that would reverse a left bundle branch block. Amiodarone is not indicated.

Checking a serum troponin is indicated in patients presenting with chest pain. For this patient to rule in for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) he has to meet two of three criteria: chest pain, ST-elevation on ECG, and elevated troponin. The patient presently meets only one of these criteria, and his ECG's ST segments are uninterpretable due to his LBBB. A negative serum troponin would rule out NSTEMI.

Otosclerosis is the abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear. This bone prevents structures within the ear from working properly and causes conductive hearing loss. It typically begins in early to mid-adulthood. It is more common in women than in men.

Mild otosclerosis can be treated with a hearing aid that amplifies sound, but surgery is often required. In a procedure known as a stapedectomy, a surgeon inserts a prosthetic device into the middle ear to bypass the abnormal bone and permit sound waves to travel to the inner ear and restore hearing.

","The correct answer is:

C. Presence of a transition zone.

In Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, a transition zone is typically observed on contrast studies such as barium enema or contrast enema. This transition zone represents the area between the aganglionic (affected) segment of the colon and the normal, ganglion cell-containing portion.

In contrast, congenital megacolon, also known as colonic dilation or congenital colonic dilatation, typically presents with generalized dilatation of the colon without a distinct transition zone. Therefore, the presence of a transition zone helps to distinguish Hirschsprung's disease from congenital megacolon on imaging studies.

Which of the following physical findings would warrant further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis?,"In addition to sudden-onset hemifacial paralysis, Bell palsy is often associated with dull postauricular pain (50% of patients), excessive tearing, dry eye, pain with loud sounds, and altered taste sensation.

Epiphora in Bell palsy may be due to the following: failure of the lacrimal pump mechanism from denervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle, increased tear production due to exposure keratopathy from paralytic lagophthalmos, and malposition of the lacrimal punctum and failure of tear drainage due to paralytic ectropion. Despite the epiphora, however, many patients will simultaneously report dry eye because of their inability to close it completely as a result of the Bell palsy.

Hyperacusis, or pain with loud sounds, and dysgeusia result from dysfunction of intratemporal branches of the facial nerve. If the stapedius muscle is denervated, patients lack the ability to dampen stapes movement in the presence of loud sounds, making them uncomfortable. The chorda tympani nerve, which conveys taste sensation from the ipsilateral anterior 2/3 of the tongue, is also a branch of the facial nerve and often functions abnormally in patients with Bell palsy.

Patients with Bell palsy do not have blepharoptosis because Bell palsy is a dysfunction of the facial nerve, which controls the orbicularis oculi muscle, among others. The orbicularis oculi closes the eye; thus, patients with Bell palsy have paralytic lagophthalmos (difficulty closing the eye), not a droopy eyelid.

A sequence is a recognized pattern that results from a single preexisting abnormality; that is, a sequencerefers to the combination of a primary defect along with its secondarystructural changes. Examples of this include the Pierre Robin sequence andthe oligohydramnios sequence. The Robin sequence is characterized by thetriad of micrognathia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis. In this disorder the primary defect is the micrognathia and this leads to the secondary structuralchanges. In the oligohydramnios (Potter) sequence the primary defect isthe oligohydramnios (which may have several causes, such as renal agenesis)and this leads to the secondary structural changes seen as the classic facialappearance (flattened facies).The term “syndrome” is often confused with the term “sequence.” Syndrome refers to multiple anomalies having a recognizable pattern andknown pathogenesis (e.g., Down syndrome). Other confusing terms include“disruption,” “association,” and “deformation.” A disruption is a defect thatresults from interference in a normally developing process. A classic example of a disruption is rupture of the amnion in utero forming amniotic bandsthat can wrap around, compress, and possibly amputate arms or legs. Anassociation is a pattern of nonrandom anomalies with an unknown mechanism, an example being the VATER association. VATER is an acronym thatrefers to the body part that can be affected: vertebrae, anus, trachea, esophagus, and radius. The cause of the VATER association is unknown. Finally adeformation is an alteration of a normally formed body part by mechanicalforces.

Fat emboli, which result from severetrauma and fractures of long bones, will stain positively with an oil red Ostain or Sudan black stain. They can be fatal as they can damage theendothelial cells and pneumocytes within the lungs. Air emboli are seen indecompression sickness, called caisson disease or the bends, while amniotic fluid emboli are related to the rupture of uterine venous sinuses as acomplication of childbirth. Amniotic fluid emboli can also lead to a fataldisease, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), which is markedby the combination of intravascular coagulation and hemorrhages.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defects, the most common congenital issue with this shunt, hinder RBCs' ability to maintain sufficient glutathione levels during oxidant stress. Consequently, hemoglobin precipitates within RBCs, forming Heinz bodies. As the G6PD gene resides on the X chromosome, affected individuals are predominantly males. G6PD deficiency is prevalent in regions historically plagued by malaria, notably among males of African, African American, Sardinian, and Sephardic descent. While most individuals with G6PD deficiency remain asymptomatic, certain triggers like infection, fava bean ingestion, or exposure to oxidative agents can incite acute hemolytic events. Smear examination may reveal bite cells, Heinz bodies, and abnormal poikilocytes. Common precipitants of G6PD crises include dapsone, sulfamethoxazole, primaquine, and nitrofurantoin.

In this case a systemic inflammatory response such as occurs in sepsis is the most likely underlying cause. Thalassaemia (E) tends to produce chronic normocytic or microcytic anaemia without serious bleeding risk. In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (C), there is a defect in an essential cell membrane protein causing intermittent release of haemoglobin, it is believed acidosis during the night increases the degree of haemoglobinuria, hence the term ‘nocturnal’.

His vitals are temperature 37.6 C (99.7 F), heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 21 breaths/min. He has a history of taking ""cool things"" at parties. Physical examination reveals clenching of jaws and frequent movement of legs. He has a significant family history of alcohol use disorder in his aunt and schizophrenia in his sister. Which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the patient's condition?","MDMA (3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine), more commonly known as Molly or ecstasy, is a synthetic substance first developed in 1912 as a precursor to hemostatic synthesis agents. Due to its effects on promoting empathy and facilitating communication, the drug became popular in the early 1970s among psychiatrists for its therapeutic potential. The drug would later find heavy use in dance parties and festivals as it became prominently associated with rave culture due to its heightened euphoric effects.

The presentation of MDMA toxicity is variable due to the common practice of co-ingestion with other illicit substances. Even self-reported mono-ingestion of ecstasy/Molly is not reliable due to the synthesized drug's varying composition. Patients may present tachycardic, hypertensive, hyperthermic, and agitated. Even at minor recreational doses, adverse effects include increased muscle activity (such as bruxism, restless legs, and jaw clenching), hyperactivity, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of restlessness. The sympathomimetic properties in MDMA overdose can lead to severe toxicity manifesting as cardiovascular, neurologic, hepatic, and electrolyte disturbances. Significant elevations in heart rate and blood pressure have led to reports of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and intracranial hemorrhages. Because MDMA undergoes hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P450, severe hepatoxicity can occur, leading to fulminant liver failure. CNS hyperactivity can lead to delirium and seizures. Elevated levels of serotonin can result in serotonin syndrome, and patients may present with hyperpyrexia and myoclonus.

MDMA differs from other amphetamines due to the methylenedioxy group's attachment, which is structurally similar to the psychedelic hallucinogen mescaline. Because of this, MDMA is a chemical compound that shares properties of both amphetamines and hallucinogens. It primarily increases the overall concentration of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin within the synaptic cleft. MDMA inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin, thereby stimulating its carrier-mediated release. In addition to the depletion of serotonin-containing vesicles, this action increases serotonin synaptic levels. Like other amphetamine analogs, MDMA also inhibits monoamine oxidase activity, which further contributes to increased levels of serotonin (in addition to dopamine and norepinephrine). Like serotonin, MDMA affects dopamine transporters, promoting their release and inhibiting reuptake. The binding of noradrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic receptors contributes to the drug's noradrenaline, histamine, GABA, and acetylcholine effects. The result is a surge of activity upon postsynaptic receptors that play a role in mood, thermoregulation, and autonomic nervous system activity.

MDMA is absorbed via the GI tract with an onset of effect between 20 minutes and 1 hour after consumption. Peak concentrations occur 2 hours after oral ingestion and are broken down in the liver by the enzyme CYP2D6. MDMA has a half-life of about 8 hours, taking approximately 40 hours to clear 95% of the body's drug.

The round ligaments are attached to the uterus anterior to the attachment of the fallopian tubes. Retroflexion implies a sharp angle between the cervix and the fundus of the uterus, which is bent posteriorly. This is a less common position of the uterus, which can also, more commonly, be midposition or anteflexed. These are all normal positions of the uterus. It is important to recognize which way the uterine body is flexed so that you do not perforate the lower uterine segment while sounding the uterus or dilating the cervix. The uterus is normally mobile and if it is not, adhesions or tumor may be present. The cervix is normally palpated anterior to the rectum on rectal examination.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s neurologic deficits?","Common peroneal nerve injury at the neck of the fibula results in numbness to the lateral leg and foot drop.

Escharotomy involves incising through areas of burnt skin to release the eschar and its constrictive effects and restore distal circulation without breaching the deep fascial layer. Structures at risk should be marked, such as the common peroneal nerve at the neck of the fibula so that extra care can be taken to avoid damage to deep structures.

The common peroneal nerve has a relatively superficial course near the incisions. For this reason, an escharotomy should ideally be performed by a plastic or burn surgeon with knowledge of the underlying anatomy. The sural nerve provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the foot and ankle.

Following escharotomy, the wounds should be monitored regularly, especially in the first 72 hours, due to high risk of bleeding, and for signs of incomplete releases, such as distal ischemia in limbs.

Which of the following organs is involved in the activation pathway of the deficient vitamin?","This infant presents with signs of rickets due to chronic vitamin D deficiency because breast milk has inadequate vitamin D levels to support an infant's nutritional requirements.

Dermal synthesis and dietary intake (fatty fish livers, fortified food) are the major sources of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), both of which are converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D2 (25-OH-D2) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) respectively in the liver by the enzyme hepatic enzyme 25–hydroxylase. Both 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 are then converted to the most active form of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. This active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases bone resorption, and decreases renal excretion of calcium and phosphate.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and/or severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization, which can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

Initial supplementation for 8 weeks with vitamin D3, either 6,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly, can be considered. Once the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level exceeds 30 ng/mL, a daily maintenance dose of 1,000 to 2,000 IU is recommended",A,Kidney,Pancreas,Bone marrow,Lungs,heart,"C. Bone marrow

Physical examination finds hyper-extensible skin, hypermobile joints, andprominent venous markings that are easily seen through his abnormal skin.Workup finds that his acute abdominal pain is due to spontaneous ruptureof his colon. Based on these clinical findings and appropriate workup, thediagnosis of type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is made. This disorder resultsfrom abnormalities involving the structural protein type III collagen. As ageneral rule, familial disorders such as type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndromethat result from abnormalities of structural proteins (rather than deficiencies of enzymes) and present during adulthood (rather than childhood)have what type of inheritance pattern?","There are several general clinical differences between autosomal dominant (AD) disorders andautosomal recessive (AR) disorders. In general, AD mutations usually involvecomplex structural proteins or regulatory proteins, while AR disorders are more likely to result from abnormalities of proteins that function as enzymes.Examples of AD disorders involving abnormalities of structural proteinsinclude Marfan’s syndrome (fibrillin), osteogenesis imperfecta (collagen),hereditary spherocytosis (spectrin), and several types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS; collagen). This later syndrome refers to a group of related disorders characterized by defects in collagen synthesis or structure. Thesedefects produce abnormalities of the skin and joints. The skin in thesepatients is fragile and hyperextensible, while the joints are hypermobile.There are at least 10 variants or subtypes of EDS, encompassing three typesof Mendelian inheritance. EDS types I, II, III, IV, and VIII have abnormalitiesinvolving the structural protein collagen, either collagen types I, III, or V, andall of these have AD modes of inheritance. In particular, type IV EDS isrelated to abnormal type III collagen and as such is associated with rupturedintestinal organs and blood vessels.Examples of AD disorders involving abnormalities of regulatory proteins include familial hyperlipidemia (LDL receptor), von Willebrand’s disease (von Willebrand factor), and hereditary angioedema (C1 esteraseinhibitor). Enzyme deficiencies are usually not associated with AD inheritance, because decreased levels of enzymes can usually be compensated for.Examples of AR disorders involving enzyme deficiencies include storagediseases and several amino acid diseases. Also note that, when comparedwith AD diseases, AR disorders tend to be more uniform in expression andthe age of onset is frequently early in life. Examples of this latter fact includediseases of the blood (sickle cell anemia and thalassemia) and the infantileform of polycystic renal disease, which has an AR inheritance.

She claims never to have had these symptoms before and wants to know if she broke her arm while intoxicated. The patient has no notable medical history, and vitals are within normal limits. She appears diaphoretic and anxious. Physical exam shows no trauma, tenderness, rash, or swelling to the upper extremity, but there is a single well-demarcated red mark on the posterior aspect of the arm. Upon closer inspection, the healthcare provider notices that the symptoms are limited to the fifth and medial fourth digits, and there is tenderness to palpation of the wrist. The involved nerve innervates which of the following muscles?","The paresthesia and numbness correspond most closely to the ulnar nerve distribution within the hand.

The history of falling asleep in a chair after drinking is relevant as a common cause of prolonged position-dependent compression of the body. If the patient falls asleep in the chair, the arms are often outstretched, with the medial aspect resting on the surface. Compression of the ulnar nerve, most commonly at the elbow, results in cubital fossa syndrome.

The ulnar nerve innervates the forearm muscles, including the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor carpi ulnaris. It also innervates the hand muscles, such as the lumbricals, palmaris brevis, hypothenar, and interosseous muscles.

Rationale: The patient is experiencing clinical seizures, as evidenced by tonic and clonic movements, moaning, and crying. However, the EEG does not show epileptiform discharges, which suggests that the seizures may not be due to an ongoing epileptic discharge. The presence of muscle artifacts on the EEG could be due to the physical movements during the seizures. Since the patient's valproic acid level is within the therapeutic range, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage at this point. A psychiatric assessment is not indicated as there is no evidence of a psychiatric condition. Introducing a new antiepileptic drug without clear evidence of its necessity could complicate the patient's treatment regimen.

Both elevated troponin and NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide predict worse outcomes in pulmonary embolism. Further prognostic signs of massive pulmonary embolism include the presence of right ventricular enlargement on computed tomography of the chest or right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiography. Conversely, the presence of hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, or cough in association with pulmonary embolism most commonly indicates a small peripheral lesion.",B,Elevated serum troponin levels,Initial presentation with hemoptysis,Initial presentation with syncope,Presence of right ventricular enlargement on CT  scan of the chest,Presence of right ventricular hypokinesis on  echocardiogram,"B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis

Rationale: Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) can be associated with a variety of pulmonary conditions, but it is not specifically indicative of a massive pulmonary embolism. Elevated serum troponin levels, syncope, right ventricular enlargement on CT scan, and right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram are more directly related to the hemodynamic impact of a massive pulmonary embolism.",B,0.88358855,0.86098707,0.8721414,0.2931034434244947,0.12499999531250018,0.25862068480380507,True

Which of the following presents with a blowing systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border and a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border?","Pulmonary atresia is the correct answer because it is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve does not form properly, leading to a complete blockage of blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. This causes blood to flow through alternative pathways, such as a patent ductus arteriosus, resulting in a blowing systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border. Additionally, the right ventricle may develop a ventricular septal defect, leading to a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.",D,Patent ductus arteriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Tetralogy of Fallot,Pulmonary atresia,Coarctation of aorta,"B. Ventricular septal defect

A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border due to the blood flow from the left to the right ventricle across the septal defect. A blowing systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border can also be associated with a VSD due to increased flow across the pulmonary valve if the defect is large.",B,0.8902792,0.8822887,0.88626593,0.47524751986275854,0.31578946874780944,0.4158415792686992,False

He mentions that he suddenly developed the symptoms when lifting a bag of cement. Symptoms are exacerbated by prolonged sitting or forceful coughing. He denies bladder or bowel dysfunction. With the patient in a relaxed, supine position, the involved lower extremity should be raised to how many degrees of hip flexion to confirm the presence of sciatica in this patient?","In this case, the patient suffers from lumbar radiculopathy, often referred to as sciatica, which is most likely secondary to a lower lumbar disc herniation. Sciatica is a debilitating condition in which the patient experiences pain and/or paresthesias in the sciatic nerve distribution or an associated lumbosacral nerve root.

Any condition that may structurally impact or compress the sciatic nerve may cause sciatica symptoms. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. In the older population, lumbar spinal stenosis may also cause these symptoms. Spondylolisthesis or a relative misalignment of one vertebra relative to another may also result in sciatic symptoms.

Patients with sciatica usually experience pain in the lumbar spine, and almost invariably, the pain will be unilateral. A common characteristic is that pain may radiate to the ipsilateral affected extremity. Patients may often describe pain or a burning sensation deep in the buttocks, and they will frequently describe paresthesia that accompanies the pain. Less commonly, there are associated with ipsilateral leg weakness.

The straight-leg test is a passive examination. The straight-leg test is performed by having the patient lie in a relaxed, supine position. The examiner then lifts the leg from the posterior aspect flexing at the hip joint and keeping the knee in full extension or keeping the leg straight. Typically pain that is reproduced between 30 to 70 degrees of hip flexion and experienced primarily in the back is likely due to a lumbar disc herniation. A contralateral or cross-straight leg raise is positive when symptoms in the affected extremity are reproduced by raising the unaffected leg.",B,0 to 30 degrees,30 to 70 degrees,70 to 90 degrees,greater than 90 degrees,80 to 90 degrees,"C. 70 to 90 degrees

Rationale: To confirm the presence of sciatica, the involved lower extremity is often positioned in a way that maximizes the tension on the sciatic nerve. This is typically achieved by flexing the hip and extending the knee, which corresponds to a range of 70 to 90 degrees of hip flexion. This position can provoke the symptoms of sciatica if the patient has a herniated disc or other nerve impingement.",C,0.8673515,0.8167683,0.84130025,0.2871794832210388,0.0700636908028725,0.2666666627082183,False

",B,False,True,N/A,N/A,N/A,"A. False

Rationale: In restrictive lung disease, both FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) and FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) are reduced proportionally, which often results in a normal or even increased FEV1/FVC ratio. However, the hallmark of restrictive lung disease is a reduced total lung capacity, not necessarily the FEV1/FVC ratio.

This NMB drug affected small, rapidly contracting muscles of the face and eyes first and diaphragm muscles last. The effect of this drug was easily reversed with neostigmine. Which of the following neuromuscular blockers was most likely administered to this patient?","There are two types of NMBs: depolarizing and nondepolarizing NMBs. Depolarizing NMBs are agonists at the nicotinic receptors, whereas nondepolarizing NMBs are antagonists at the nicotinic receptors. Both types of NMBs affect the rapidly contracting muscles (face, eye, etc.) first and diaphragm muscles last. However, cholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine increase ACh levels in the NMJ and reverse the effects of nondepolarizing NMBs, but not those of depolarizing NMBs. Therefore, the NMB administered to this patient is most probably rocuronium, which is a nondepolarizing NMB. Tubocurarine is also a nondepolarizing NMB, but it is not used in practice. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing NMB, and diazepam is a benzodiazepine that does not cause paralysis of skeletal muscles.",A,Rocuronium,Succinylcholine,Diazepam,Tubocurarine,Paracetamol,"D. Tubocurarine

Rationale: Tubocurarine is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that acts by competing with acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis. It tends to affect smaller muscles first, such as those of the face and eyes, and has a longer duration of action compared to some other neuromuscular blockers. Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can reverse the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers like tubocurarine. The other options listed do not fit the description as accurately: Rocuronium is also a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker but does not typically have the same order of muscle effect, Succinylcholine is a depolarizing agent and its effects are not easily reversed with neostigmine, Diazepam is a benzodiazepine and does not cause neuromuscular blockade, and Paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic, not a neuromuscular blocker.",D,0.8546941,0.86328524,0.8589682,0.33121018609923325,0.13157894238227166,0.3057324790928639,False

Rationale: The symptoms described are indicative of an inguinal hernia, which is common in infants and can present as a swollen mass in the groin area. The fact that the mass is acutely swollen and could potentially extend to the scrotum suggests that it is incarcerated, meaning it cannot be easily reduced.
