###Answer:","A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, along with the laboratory findings of normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), are indicative of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). AIHA is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys red blood cells, leading to anemia. The positive DAT indicates the presence of antibodies or complement proteins on the surface of red blood cells, which is a hallmark of AIHA. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) can also present with thrombocytopenia, but they do not typically cause a positive DAT. Iron deficiency anemia and hereditary spherocytosis are associated with microcytic anemia, not normocytic anemia.",A,True,0.34615384250184916,0.19259258948257893,0.34615384250184916,0.83832175,0.91444325,0.8747296

C.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
D.  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
E.  Autoimmune hepatitis

###Answer:","C. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection

Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common cause of chronic liver disease in African adults. This is due to the high prevalence of HBV infection in this region, which is often transmitted from mother to child during birth or through exposure to infected blood or body fluids. While alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and autoimmune hepatitis can also cause chronic liver disease, HBV infection is more prevalent and thus a more common cause in African adults.",C,True,0.2933333298275556,0.14736841825152358,0.26666666316088894,0.8476701,0.8939111,0.8701767

###Answer:","C. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS)

Rationale: The first line of management for menorrhagia is usually a non-surgical approach. In this case, the Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is the most appropriate choice. It is a hormonal intrauterine device that releases levonorgestrel, a progestin, which helps to reduce menstrual bleeding. This option is less invasive than a hysterectomy and can be reversed if the patient desires to have children in the future.

C.  A vaccine is not available
D.  MDR-TB refers to TB that is resistant to Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
E.  It does not affect cattle

###Answer:","B. First-line therapy in adults consists of 4 drugs

Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The first-line therapy for TB in adults typically consists of a combination of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This combination therapy is used to prevent the development of drug-resistant strains of the bacteria.

A. Tuberculin skin test is not diagnostic: While the tuberculin skin test (TST) can indicate exposure to the bacteria, it is not diagnostic of active TB disease. Other tests, such as sputum culture or molecular tests, are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

C. A vaccine is available: The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is available and is used in some countries to protect against severe forms of TB in children. However, its effectiveness in preventing pulmonary TB in adults is variable.

D. MDR-TB refers to TB that is resistant to Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol: MDR-TB stands for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs.

###Answer:","E. Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, and positive HIV antibody test suggest a diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients. The first-line treatment for PJP is cotrimoxazole, not macrolides. Dapsone can be used as a second-line treatment or prophylaxis.

D.  He should offer IPT (Isoniazid preventive therapy) to HIV patients with cough, fever, and night sweats
E.  He should delay anti-retroviral therapy in HIV/TB co-infected patients till they complete TB therapy

###Answer:","C. N-95 Filter is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation

Rationale: The N-95 filter mask is designed to filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, including bacteria and viruses, making it more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation. This is particularly important in healthcare settings where there is a risk of exposure to airborne pathogens like tuberculosis. The other options are not entirely accurate. BCG vaccination is not routinely recommended for healthcare workers in countries with low TB incidence. A positive Mantoux test indicates exposure to TB, not necessarily protection against it.

Rationale: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that typically affects the rectum and extends proximally to involve the colon in continuity. When backwash ileitis is seen, it indicates that the inflammation has extended to involve the terminal ileum. This suggests that the inflammation has spread throughout the colon, hence the whole colon is involved.",E,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7793137,0.8652309,0.820028

D.  Stroke
E.  . Head Injury

###Answer:","B. Ascites

Rationale: The urinary D-xylose test is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate the absorption capacity of the small intestine. D-xylose is a sugar that does not require pancreatic enzymes for absorption. It is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa and excreted in the urine. In malabsorption syndromes, the absorption of D-xylose is impaired, leading to a decrease in urinary excretion.

Ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, can give a false positive result in the urinary D-xylose test. This is because ascites can cause a decrease in the absorption of D-xylose, leading to a decrease in urinary excretion, which can be misinterpreted as a sign of malabsorption.

Rationale: The pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is primarily due to the hypersensitivity response to the products of TB bacteria. When the immune system encounters the bacteria, it triggers a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, also known as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. This response involves the activation of T-cells and macrophages, leading to the formation of granulomas, which are the hallmark of TB infection.

Rationale: In malaria, the Plasmodium parasites, after being inoculated into the human host by the Anopheles mosquito, initially infect the liver cells (hepatocytes) where they multiply. After this liver stage, the parasites are released into the bloodstream and invade red blood cells (RBCs), where they mature and multiply further. This is the stage that causes the clinical symptoms of malaria. The other options are either incorrect or not the primary characteristic of malaria.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7627884,0.85889506,0.8079939

###Answer:","E. Ivermectin

Rationale: Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. The treatment of choice for Onchocerciasis is Ivermectin, which is an antiparasitic medication that effectively kills the larvae (microfilariae) of the worm, reducing the symptoms and preventing further transmission of the disease.

Rationale: Yellow fever virus primarily affects the liver, causing hepatitis. The liver is divided into zones based on the hepatic acinus model, with Zone 1 being the periportal zone and Zone 3 being the centrilobular zone. The virus tends to affect Zone 3 the most, as this area is more susceptible to hypoxia and ischemia, which are conditions that can be exacerbated by the systemic effects of the virus.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.766102,0.86393684,0.8120834

###Answer:","E. More than 10 years

Rationale: Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blackflies. Vector control, which involves reducing the population of blackflies, is a crucial component of onchocerciasis elimination programs. However, the life cycle of the parasite and the persistence of the blackfly vector mean that vector control measures must be sustained for more than 10 years to ensure the elimination of onchocerciasis from a designated region. This is because the adult worms can live for up to 15 years in the human body, and the microfilariae can persist for several years. Therefore, even if the vector population is reduced, the disease can still be transmitted if the adult worms are still present in the human population.",E,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7430692,0.8473923,0.7918093

B.  metabolic alkalosis
C.  chronic kidney disease
D.  hyperglycemia

###Answer:","A. metabolic acidosis

Rationale: P. Falciparum malaria is known to cause severe complications, one of which is metabolic acidosis. This condition occurs when the body produces too much acid or when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. In the case of P. Falciparum malaria, the parasite's invasion of red blood cells and subsequent destruction can lead to an accumulation of lactic acid, causing metabolic acidosis. The other options, metabolic alkalosis, chronic kidney disease, and hyperglycemia, are not typically associated with severe features of P.

C.  Fever is usual in adults
D.  Vibrio cholera of the 01 serotype is the only cause of clinical disease.
E.  Responds to therapy with Amoxiclav.

###Answer:","A. Low gastric pH protects against infection

Rationale: Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which is sensitive to acidic environments. A low gastric pH, which indicates a more acidic stomach, can help protect against cholera infection by killing or inhibiting the growth of the bacteria before they reach the intestines.

Option B is incorrect because cholera toxin actually increases intracellular levels of cAMP, leading to the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestines, causing diarrhea.

Option C is incorrect because fever is not a usual symptom of cholera in adults. The primary symptom is profuse watery diarrhea, often described as ""rice-water stools.""

Option D is incorrect because there are other serotypes of Vibrio cholerae, such as O139, that can also cause clinical disease.

Rationale: Arthropod-borne haemorrhagic fevers are caused by viruses transmitted by arthropods, such as mosquitoes and ticks. Among the options provided, Dengue haemorrhagic fever is the only one that fits this description. It is caused by the dengue virus, which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and Yellow fever are not arthropod-borne diseases. Lassa fever is caused by the Lassa virus, which is transmitted by rodents. Ebola virus disease and Marburg haemorrhagic fever are caused by filoviruses, which are transmitted through direct contact with infected body fluids.

###Answer:","C. There is very low or absent malarial antibody titers

Rationale: Tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS) is a condition characterized by massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism in individuals living in malaria-endemic areas. It is associated with a chronic immune response to repeated malarial infections, particularly with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. Despite the presence of malaria, individuals with TSS often have very low or absent malarial antibody titers.

D.  Corticosteroid therapy is helpful
E.  Mental retardation is a risk factor

###Answer:","B. Cough and breathlessness are common manifestations

Rationale: Kerosene poisoning often occurs due to accidental ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure. The common manifestations of kerosene poisoning include cough, breathlessness, and gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms are due to the irritant effect of kerosene on the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

Option A is incorrect because school-age children are not the most at risk group for kerosene poisoning. In fact, children under the age of 5 are more at risk due to their curiosity and tendency to put objects in their mouths.

Option C is incorrect because early gastric lavage is not recommended in kerosene poisoning. This is because kerosene is a hydrocarbon, and gastric lavage can increase the risk of aspiration and lung injury.

Option D is incorrect because corticosteroid therapy is not helpful in kerosene poisoning. There is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the management of kerosene poisoning.

Rationale: Pyogenic meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain and spinal cord. Chronic otalgia, or long-term ear pain, can be a risk factor for pyogenic meningitis because it may indicate an ongoing infection in the ear that could spread to the meninges. The other options are not valid concerning pyogenic meningitis. Haematogenous spread is a common source of infection, but not the only one.

###Options:
A.  History of lack of immunization
B.  Board-like abdominal rigidity
C.  Mask-like expressionless face
D.  Suppurative ear discharge
E.  Glasgow Coma Score of 4/15

###Answer:","D. Suppurative ear discharge

Rationale: The symptoms described in the question are suggestive of a condition called tetanus, which is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The bacteria usually enter the body through a wound or cut. The symptoms include muscle stiffness and spasms, difficulty opening the mouth (trismus), and a characteristic facial expression (risus sardonicus). 

A history of lack of immunization (Option A) is relevant because tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease. Board-like abdominal rigidity (Option B) and a mask-like expressionless face (Option C) are both symptoms of tetanus. The Glasgow Coma Score (Option E) is a measure of consciousness and could be relevant if the child's condition is severe.

Suppurative ear discharge (Option D), however, is not typically associated with tetanus. It is more likely to be related to an ear infection or other ear-related conditions.

###Options:
A.  Nephroblastoma
B.  Cystitis
C.  Schistosomiasis
D.  Renal vein thrombosis

###Answer:","C. Schistosomiasis

Rationale: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. It is endemic in many rural areas, particularly in Africa, Asia, and South America. One of the common symptoms of schistosomiasis is painless haematuria, which is the presence of blood in urine without any associated pain. This is due to the inflammation and damage caused by the parasite to the urinary tract. 

Nephroblastoma, also known as Wilms' tumor, is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. While it can cause haematuria, it is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as abdominal pain, swelling, and weight loss.

Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by a bacterial infection. It can cause haematuria, but it is typically painful, not painless.

Renal vein thrombosis is a blood clot in the vein that drains blood from the kidney. It can cause haematuria, but it is usually associated with other symptoms such as flank pain, fever, and decreased kidney function.

Given the rural setting of the primary school and the symptom of painless haematuria, schistosomiasis is the most likely aetiology.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73378825,0.8588921,0.7914268

###Answer:","B. Both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation.

Rationale: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. This is different from an autosomal dominant pattern (option A) where only one copy of the gene needs to have a mutation for the disease to be expressed.

Rationale: Option D suggests a comprehensive approach to preventing acute diarrhea in mothers and children in Lagos State, Nigeria. It includes promoting good hygiene practices, ensuring access to clean water, and providing education on proper nutrition. These measures are crucial in reducing the incidence of diarrhea, which is often caused by contaminated water and poor sanitation.

Option A focuses only on vaccination, which is not the sole preventive measure for acute diarrhea. Option B emphasizes the importance of breastfeeding, which is indeed beneficial for the child's immune system, but it does not address the broader issue of preventing diarrhea.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Acute glomerulonephritis.
B.  Severe malaria.
C.  Septicaemia
D.  Viral hepatitis.

###Answer:","B. Severe malaria.

Rationale: The boy's symptoms of fever, poor feeding, dark urine, jaundice, and splenomegaly, along with his low haematocrit and low blood pressure, are indicative of severe malaria. Malaria is endemic in Nigeria, and the boy's age and weight also fit the profile for severe malaria. Acute glomerulonephritis, septicaemia, and viral hepatitis could present with similar symptoms, but the combination of symptoms and the boy's location make severe malaria the most likely diagnosis.",B,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75248015,0.8566219,0.801181

###Answer:","B. Wertheim's hysterectomy involves removal of the ovaries

Rationale: Wertheim's hysterectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat cervical cancer. It involves the removal of the uterus, cervix, upper part of the vagina, and surrounding tissues. In addition, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are usually removed as well. This procedure is designed to remove all cancerous tissue and reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. The other options are either incorrect or not directly related to the treatment of cervical cancer.",B,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7596309,0.85366964,0.80390954

###Question: A 10-year old female with chronic cough has a tuberculin test result of 10mm. What should the next important line of action be?

###Options:
A.  Request Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate.
B.  Request a Chest X-ray.
C.  Commence anti-tuberculous drugs.
D.  Request BCG vaccine administration.

###Answer:","B. Request a Chest X-ray.

Rationale: A positive tuberculin test result in a child with chronic cough suggests the possibility of tuberculosis infection. The next important step is to request a Chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is a non-specific test and may not provide useful information in this case. Anti-tuberculous drugs should only be commenced after a confirmed diagnosis. BCG vaccine administration is not indicated in this case as it is a preventive measure and not a diagnostic tool.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.76256186,0.8595988,0.80817795
