###Answer:","D. Trachoma

Rationale:
Trachoma is the leading cause of blindness in African adults. It is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection spreads through direct contact with eye, nose, or throat secretions of affected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects. Repeated infections can lead to scarring of the eyelid, which can cause the eyelashes to turn inward and scratch the cornea, leading to blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified trachoma as a neglected tropical disease and has implemented the SAFE strategy (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement) to control and eliminate the disease.",D,False,0.17777777471358028,0.10344827336058271,0.17777777471358028,0.81973094,0.88251555,0.8499654

D.  folic acid supplementation
E.  malaria prophylaxis

###Answer:","D. Folic acid supplementation

Rationale: Folic acid supplementation is a valid management strategy for sickle cell anemia in the steady state in Nigeria. Folic acid is essential for the production of new red blood cells, and patients with sickle cell anemia have an increased need for folic acid due to the increased turnover of red blood cells. This supplementation helps to prevent anemia and other complications associated with the disease. While other options like blood transfusion and intravenous fluids may be used in acute situations, they are not part of the steady state management. Steady state hemoglobin levels are a goal of management, but not a management strategy. Malaria prophylaxis is important for patients with sickle cell anemia due to their increased susceptibility to malaria, but it is not a direct management strategy for the disease itself.",D,False,0.179775278247696,0.0,0.15730336813533646,0.8081182,0.8731189,0.839362

A.  Conservative management with physical therapy
B.  Open ACL repair
C.  Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction
D.  Knee brace immobilization
E.  Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint

###Answer:","C. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). In this case, the most appropriate treatment option is arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. This minimally invasive surgical procedure involves replacing the torn ACL with a graft, usually taken from the patient's own patellar tendon or hamstring tendon.

People with this genotype usually do not experience the symptoms of sickle cell disease, but they can pass the gene to their offspring. The other options (A, B, C, and E) are all risk factors for sickle cell disease in Nigeria. Malaria (A) is a significant risk factor because individuals with sickle cell trait have some protection against malaria, which can lead to a higher prevalence of the sickle cell gene in the population. Family history of sickle cell disease (B) is a risk factor because the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

###Answer:","E. All of the above

Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) in African adults commonly presents with a combination of symptoms and signs. Pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate the presence of TB in the lungs. Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood, can occur due to the damage caused by the infection in the lung tissue. Night sweats are a common symptom of TB, caused by the body's immune response to the infection. Weight loss is also a common symptom of TB, as the infection can cause a decrease in appetite and an increase in metabolic rate.

###Options:
A.  alcohol
B.  aqueous mecurochrome
C.  Dermazine cream+sufratulle
D.  Honey
E.  vaseline impregnated with penicillin

###Answer:","C. Dermazine cream+sufratulle

Rationale:
Major omphalocele is a congenital abdominal wall defect where the intestines, liver, and occasionally other organs remain outside of the abdomen in a sac. Non-operative management of this condition involves the use of dressings and creams to protect the exposed organs and reduce the risk of infection.

In Nigeria, the most appropriate non-operative management for major omphalocele would be the combination of Dermazine cream and Sufratulle. Dermazine cream is a topical antibiotic that helps prevent infection, while Sufratulle is a protective dressing that provides a moist environment for the exposed organs. This combination helps to maintain the integrity of the exposed organs and reduce the risk of complications.

The other options listed are not suitable for non-operative management of major omphalocele:

A. Alcohol is a toxic substance and should never be used in medical treatments.
B. Aqueous mecurochrome is a discontinued topical antiseptic that is no longer recommended due to potential carcinogenic effects.
D. Honey has antimicrobial properties, but it is not a suitable dressing for major omphalocele, as it can cause irritation and is not as effective in preventing infection as Dermazine cream.

###Answer:","B. Mitral regurgitation

Rationale:
Infective endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves or the endocardium. It can lead to various complications, including valvular dysfunction. Among the options provided, mitral regurgitation is a common complication of infective endocarditis. This occurs when the infection damages the mitral valve, causing it to leak blood backward into the left atrium. In some cases, surgical intervention may be required to repair or replace the damaged valve. The other options listed are not as directly related to infective endocarditis as mitral regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can occur due to infective endocarditis, but it is less common than mitral regurgitation. Ventricular septal defect, atrial fibrillation, and aortic dissection are not typical complications of infective endocarditis.",B,False,0.239999997048,0.031249997583008,0.19999999704800003,0.835461,0.9057594,0.8691911

###Answer:","C. The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are haemorrhage sepsis hypertensive disease abortion and obstructed labour

Rationale: The correct answer is C because it accurately lists the five major causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya, which are haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disease, abortion, and obstructed labour. These causes are well-documented in various health reports and studies.

A is incorrect because Kenya has not yet attained the MDG target for maternal mortality. The MDG target was to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by 75% between 1990 and 2015, and Kenya has not achieved this goal.

B is incorrect because death from HIV in pregnancy is not considered a direct maternal death. Direct maternal deaths are those that occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, and are caused by obstetric complications. HIV-related deaths are considered indirect maternal deaths.

D is incorrect because maternal mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio are not the same. The maternal mortality rate is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, while the maternal mortality ratio is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 women of reproductive age.

E.  The dose of IV quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy, should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency

###Answer:","B. The recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester is a three-day course of artemether lumefantrine (AL)

Rationale:
The Kenyan protocol for the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy recommends artemether lumefantrine (AL) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester. This is because AL has a good safety profile and is effective in treating malaria in pregnant women. The other options are not true according to the protocol. Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) can be given concomitantly with antiretrovirals, Dihydroartemisinin Piperaquine is not recommended for IPTp, and Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp should not be given concomitantly with IFAS.

###Answer:","C. Refer to the public health specialist for start of anti-TB

Rationale: The patient has been diagnosed with TB of the Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT), specifically in the ileum. The most appropriate intervention for this patient would be to refer them to a public health specialist for the initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment. This approach is based on the fact that TB is a bacterial infection that can be effectively treated with a combination of antibiotics. Surgical intervention, such as resection of the ileum, is not the first line of treatment for TB of the GIT, as the disease can be managed with medication.

###Answer:","D. All the above

Rationale: Colorectal cancers are relatively less frequent in African due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the young age of the population in Africa means that individuals have a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer as the risk increases with age. Secondly, the large intake of high-fiber diets in African countries helps to shorten the transit time of faeces, reducing the exposure of the colon to potential carcinogens.

###Answer:","C. Band and adhesions

Rationale: Band and adhesions are the most common causes of small bowel obstruction in Ghana. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form between abdominal tissues and organs, often as a result of previous abdominal surgery. These adhesions can cause the small intestine to become twisted or kinked, leading to obstruction.

This combination provides broad coverage against the most common pathogens causing CAP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical bacteria like Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (Option A) are fluoroquinolones, which are not the first-line treatment for CAP. Vancomycin (Option C) is primarily used for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Linezolid (Option D) is an antibiotic used for resistant infections, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

D.  Tuberculosis
E.  Pulmonary embolism

###Answer:","A. Community-acquired pneumonia

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain, along with the acute onset and short duration of the illness, are most consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CAP is a common infection in young adults and typically presents with these symptoms. The other options are less likely given the patient's age, symptoms, and the duration of the illness.

###Answer:","D. Tuberculous lymphadenitis explains the findings

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, and positive HIV status suggest a diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). The bilateral peri-hilar interstitial infiltrates in a butterfly pattern are characteristic of TB, and the patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV infection increases their susceptibility to TB. Tuberculous lymphadenitis can also present with similar findings. Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that typically affects the central nervous system in immunocompromised patients.

D.  He should offer IPT (Isoniazid preventive therapy) to HIV patients with cough, fever, and night sweats
E.  He should delay anti-retroviral therapy in HIV/TB co-infected patients till they complete TB therapy

###Answer:","C. N-95 Filter is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation

Rationale:
A Level Six student in a medical ward is at a higher risk of exposure to tuberculosis (TB) due to the nature of their work. Among the given options, the most accurate statement regarding TB prevention is that an N-95 filter is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation. N-95 respirators are designed to filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, including TB bacteria, while surgical masks primarily protect against large droplets and do not provide a tight seal around the face. Therefore, wearing an N-95 respirator is the best option for preventing TB infection in this scenario.

Option A is incorrect because the BCG vaccine is not widely used in the United States due to its variable efficacy and potential side effects. It is primarily used in countries with high TB prevalence.

Option B is incorrect because a positive Mantoux test indicates TB exposure or latent TB infection, not protection against TB.

Option D is incorrect because IPT is recommended for HIV patients with latent TB infection or those with a positive TB skin test, not for those with active TB symptoms.

###Question: When considering preventive therapy in HIV patients which of these statements is TRUE?
###Options:
A.  Universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is mandatory for all patients unless contraindicated
B.  Dapsone can be used when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated for prophylaxis and should be continued indefinitely
C.  Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months
D.  A course of Isoniazid preventive therapy should only be offered to patients who have a history of TB contact
E.  Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy should be given to all patients with a CD4 < 100cells/uL when they are initiating antiretroviral treatment

###Answer:","C. Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months

Rationale:
The primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in HIV patients is typically Cotrimoxazole. However, it is not mandatory for all patients unless contraindicated (Option A). Dapsone can be used as an alternative when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated, but it should not be continued indefinitely without reassessment (Option B). Primary prophylaxis for PCP can be discontinued when the CD4 count is maintained above 200 cells/uL for more than 6 months, indicating a significant improvement in immune function (Option C). Isoniazid preventive therapy is not exclusively offered to patients with a history of TB contact; it is also recommended for patients with a CD4 count < 50cells/uL regardless of TB history (Option D). Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy is recommended for all patients with a CD4 < 100cells/uL when they are initiating antiretroviral treatment, not just those with a CD4 < 100cells/uL (Option E).",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.715091,0.86139274,0.78145325

E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","A. An intercurrent infection can cause this

Rationale:
A patient who has been on antiretrovirals for 6 years and has maintained undetectable viral loads with his first-line regimen may experience a temporary increase in viral load due to an intercurrent infection. Infections can cause inflammation and immune activation, which can lead to a temporary increase in viral replication and, consequently, an increase in viral load.

###Answer:","D. In HIV-infected individuals, glucocorticoids are contraindicated in the treatment of tuberculous meningitis.

Rationale:
Glucocorticoids are contraindicated in the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in HIV-infected individuals because they can suppress the immune system and potentially worsen the infection. The use of glucocorticoids in this context can lead to an increased risk of adverse effects and complications. The other options are not accurate:

A. The lifetime risk for developing active TB in HIV-infected individuals is not twice that of HIV-uninfected individuals; it is significantly higher due to the weakened immune system.

E.  The Oral HIV test demonstrates that there is some risk of transmission from oral secretions.

###Answer:","D. The seroconversion window period refers to the time from infection to the time when the laboratory is able to detect HIV antibodies.

Rationale: The seroconversion window period is the time between the initial HIV infection and the point when the body produces enough antibodies to be detected by a laboratory test. During this period, an individual may have been infected with HIV, but the test results may still be negative. This is because the body needs time to produce a sufficient amount of antibodies to be detected by the test. The other options are incorrect because:

###Answer:","C. Blantyre coma score of 4/5

Rationale:
The Blantyre coma scale is a simplified version of the Glasgow Coma Scale specifically designed for use in sub-Saharan Africa. It assesses the level of consciousness in malaria patients, and a score of 4/5 indicates a moderate level of impairment. This scale is more relevant to assessing the severity of malaria in a patient compared to the other options, which are not specific indicators of malaria severity.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7787343,0.8608783,0.8177486

###Answer:","A. H+, K+ ATPase

Rationale:
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disorder that affects the stomach's ability to produce intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. The presence of anti-parietal cell antibodies indicates an immune response against the parietal cells in the stomach lining. These antibodies target the H+, K+ ATPase enzyme, also known as the proton pump, which is responsible for secreting hydrogen ions (H+) into the stomach in exchange for potassium ions (K+). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the production of gastric acid, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. By attacking the H+, K+ ATPase, the immune system disrupts the normal function of the parietal cells, leading to a decrease in gastric acid production and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency.",A,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7463601,0.8571633,0.79793346

###Answer:","D. due to caseous necrosis

Rationale:
The pathogenicity of Mycobacterium TB is primarily due to the formation of caseous necrosis in the infected tissues. Caseous necrosis is a type of cell death in which the tissue maintains a cheese-like appearance. This process is a result of the immune response to the infection, where the body's immune cells attempt to contain the bacteria by forming granulomas. However, the center of these granulomas undergoes caseous necrosis, which provides a favorable environment for the bacteria to survive and multiply.

B.  Less than 1 % of tetanus can occur without a wound identified
C.  incubation periods can be from less than 24 hours to > 1month
D.  patients who have survived the disease confer a 10 year immunity to the disease.
E.  Does not respond to Metronidazole

###Answer:","A. Spasm begins in the pripheris and spreads truncal then into facial muscles

Rationale: Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin that affects the nervous system. The initial symptoms of tetanus include muscle stiffness and spasms, which typically start in the jaw (pripheris) and neck (truncal) and then spread to the facial muscles. This is a characteristic feature of tetanus and helps differentiate it from other conditions.

B. Less than 1% of tetanus can occur without a wound identified

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. Tetanus is primarily associated with wounds, especially deep puncture wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, or feces, where the bacteria Clostridium tetani can thrive. While it is possible for tetanus to occur without a wound, it is extremely rare, and the majority of cases are linked to wounds.

C. Incubation periods can be from less than 24 hours to > 1 month

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. The incubation period for tetanus is typically between 3 and 21 days, with an average of 8-14 days. It is uncommon for the incubation period to be less than 24 hours or more than 1 month.

D. Patients who have survived the disease confer a 10-year immunity to the disease.

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. Tetanus is a life-threatening condition, and surviving it does not confer long-term immunity. In fact, individuals who have survived tetanus are at risk of developing the disease again if they are exposed to the bacteria. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent tetanus.

E. Does not respond to Metronidazole

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that can be used to treat tetanus in combination with other medications, such as penicillin G. While it is not the primary treatment for tetanus,",A,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72762084,0.8181638,0.77024055

E.  Quinine is the first-line drug of choice in uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria

###Answer:","B. P. Faciparum can remain dormant in the intrahepatic cells for months and later activate to cause clinical relapse

Rationale: P. falciparum, the most dangerous species of malaria parasite, can form dormant stages called hypnozoites in the liver. These hypnozoites can remain inactive for months or even years before reactivating and causing a clinical relapse of malaria. This is a unique characteristic of P. falciparum and is not seen in other malaria species like P. vivax or P. ovale. The other options are incorrect because:

A. Clinical symptoms begin when merozoites, not sporozoites, invade the hepatic parenchymal cells.
C. P. vivax and P. ovale can cause relapses, but not due to new merozoites released during the erythrocytic phase; they are caused by reactivation of hypnozoites in the liver.

Rationale: African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted by the tsetse fly. The disease has two forms: the Gambian form and the Rhodesian form. The Gambian form is found in West and Central Africa and is characterized by a more rapid progression, while the Rhodesian form is found in East and Southern Africa and has a slower progression. Treatment options for the Gambian form include pentamidine, while the Rhodesian form is treated with suramin.

###Question: Common causes of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children include:
###Options:
A.  Pneumonia
B.  Tetralogy of Fallot
C.  Bronchial asthma
D.  Transposition of Great Arteries
E.  Septicemia

###Answer:","E. Septicemia

Rationale: Septicemia, also known as blood poisoning, is a common cause of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children. This condition occurs when bacteria or other germs (microorganisms) enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body, leading to a systemic inflammatory response. This inflammatory response can cause damage to multiple organs, including the heart, leading to congestive cardiac failure. In Nigeria, septicemia is often associated with poor sanitation, inadequate access to healthcare, and high rates of infectious diseases.

While pneumonia, tetralogy of Fallot, bronchial asthma, and transposition of great arteries can also cause congestive cardiac failure, they are not as common in Nigerian children as septicemia. Pneumonia is a leading cause of death in children worldwide, but it is not as directly linked to congestive cardiac failure as septicemia. Tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of great arteries are congenital heart defects that can lead to heart failure, but they are relatively rare in Nigerian children. Bronchial asthma can cause respiratory distress and exacerbate heart failure in some cases, but it is not a direct cause of congestive cardiac failure.",E,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7447854,0.84130466,0.79010826

###Answer:","B. Both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation.

Rationale: Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The disease is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called beta-globin, a component of hemoglobin. Individuals with two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) have sickle cell disease.

###Question: WRITE A SHORT NOTE ON THE WAYS OF PREVENTING ACUTE DIARRHEA DISEASE IN MOTHERS AND CHILDREN IN LAGOS STATE NIGERIA 
###Options:

###Answer:","Answer: Implementing proper hygiene practices, ensuring safe drinking water, and promoting breastfeeding.

Rationale:

Acute diarrhea is a common illness in Lagos State, Nigeria, and can be prevented through various measures. The following are some of the ways to prevent acute diarrhea in mothers and children:

1. Implementing proper hygiene practices: Maintaining good personal hygiene, such as regular handwashing with soap and water, can significantly reduce the risk of contracting diarrhea-causing pathogens. Mothers should teach their children the importance of handwashing, especially before eating and after using the toilet.

2. Ensuring safe drinking water: Access to clean and safe drinking water is crucial in preventing diarrhea. Mothers should boil or treat water before giving it to their children, especially in areas where waterborne diseases are prevalent. Additionally, using water filters or purification tablets can help remove harmful microorganisms from water sources.

3. Promoting breastfeeding: Breastfeeding provides essential nutrients and antibodies that help protect infants from infections, including diarrhea. Mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their children exclusively for the first six months of life and continue breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years or beyond.

4. Safe food handling and preparation: Mothers should be educated on the importance of proper food handling and preparation to prevent foodborne illnesses. This includes washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly, cooking foods at appropriate temperatures, and avoiding cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods.

5. Vaccination: Vaccines such as Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) and Rotavirus vaccine can help protect children from diarrhea-causing pathogens. Mothers should ensure their children receive the recommended vaccinations according to the national immunization schedule.
