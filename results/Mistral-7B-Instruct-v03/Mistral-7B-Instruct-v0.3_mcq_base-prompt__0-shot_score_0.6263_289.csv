A.  Infants should be breastfed exclusively for 4 months
B.  Only 30% of children are exclusively breastfed
C.  In the baby friendly initiative, mothers with inverted nipples should still breastfeed exclusively
D.  In HIV infected babies, breastfeeding should stop at one year
E.  Exclusive breastfeeding reduces the incidence of asthma.

###Answer:","A. Infants should be breastfed exclusively for 4 months

Rationale:
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend that infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life. However, in Kenya, the recommended period is four months as per the Kenya Ministry of Health guidelines. This is because breast milk provides all the nutrients that the infant needs for the first four months of life. After four months, complementary foods can be introduced while continuing breastfeeding.

Option B is incorrect because the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Kenya is higher than 30%. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 58% of children were exclusively breastfed.

Option C is incorrect because mothers with inverted nipples may face challenges in breastfeeding, but they can still breastfeed with the help of a lactation consultant or a healthcare provider.

Option D is incorrect because in HIV infected babies, breastfeeding should continue up to 12 months or beyond, if possible, while the mother is on antiretroviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Option E is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that exclusive breastfeeding reduces the incidence of asthma.

D.  folic acid supplementation
E.  malaria prophylaxis

###Answer:","D. folic acid supplementation

Rationale:
Folic acid supplementation is a crucial part of the management of sickle cell anemia in the steady state. It helps to prevent folate deficiency, which is common in patients with sickle cell disease due to increased red blood cell turnover. Folic acid supplementation can help to reduce the risk of megaloblastic anemia and improve the overall health of the patient.

While steady state hemoglobin, blood transfusion, intravenous fluids, and malaria prophylaxis are also important in the management of sickle cell anemia, they are not the correct answer to the question as they are not the only valid management options in the steady state.

Steady state hemoglobin refers to the normal range of hemoglobin levels in a patient with sickle cell anemia, which is typically lower than in a person without the disease. Blood transfusion is used to increase hemoglobin levels and prevent complications such as anemia and acute chest syndrome. Intravenous fluids are used to prevent dehydration and maintain adequate hydration in patients with sickle cell anemia. Malaria prophylaxis is important in areas where malaria is endemic, as patients with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk of malaria. However, these are not the only valid management options in the steady state.",D,False,0.16071428352678574,0.011627905481341457,0.12499999781250003,0.78793156,0.8643692,0.8243823

Rationale:
The symptoms presented by the patient, such as auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, disorganized speech, and social withdrawal, are characteristic of schizophrenia. While these symptoms can also be present in other mental health disorders, they are more commonly associated with schizophrenia. In African cultures, these symptoms may be interpreted as spiritual possession or influence, but the underlying diagnosis is still schizophrenia.

Rationale:
Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) are the first-line treatment for acute asthma exacerbations due to their rapid onset of action, which helps to relieve symptoms such as wheezing, dyspnea, and chest tightness. Inhaled corticosteroids are used for maintenance therapy, not for acute exacerbations. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are not appropriate for acute exacerbations because they have a slower onset of action and are used for maintenance therapy in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.

Infected wounds in rural African communities often have a high risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis or other severe infections due to limited access to healthcare and potential delays in seeking treatment. Surgical debridement and irrigation are essential for removing necrotic tissue, reducing the bacterial load, and promoting wound healing. Topical antibiotics and dressings may not be sufficient for managing deep, infected wounds. Oral antibiotics can be used as adjunctive therapy but should not be the primary management strategy.

###Answer:","E. Gout
Rationale: The patient's symptoms of progressive hip pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, along with imaging findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, are consistent with osteoarthritis. However, the elevated levels of serum uric acid suggest a different diagnosis. Gout is a form of arthritis characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in joints, leading to inflammation, pain, and swelling. This condition is often associated with high levels of serum uric acid. Therefore, Gout is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

E.  Meniscus tear

###Answer:","C. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury

Rationale:
The anterior drawer test is used to evaluate the ACL. In this test, the tibia is pulled forward relative to the femur, and a positive test indicates ACL injury. The MCL and LCL are located on the sides of the knee, not in the front, so they are less likely to be involved in this scenario. The PCL is located at the back of the knee, so it is not involved in this injury. A meniscus tear can cause knee pain and swelling, but it is not typically associated with a positive anterior drawer test.

Rationale:
Chronic liver disease is a significant health problem in many African countries, and HBV infection is a major cause of this disease in the region. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 6% of the global population is chronically infected with HBV, and this percentage is even higher in some African countries, such as Nigeria (14%) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (10%).

Rationale:
The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disease, abortion, and obstructed labour. This is based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) classification of the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide.

A. Kenya has not almost attained the MDG target for maternal mortality. The maternal mortality ratio in Kenya is still high, and the country is working towards achieving the MDG target.

B. Death from HIV in pregnancy is an indirect maternal death, not a direct maternal death. Direct maternal deaths are those that occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy from obstetric causes. Indirect maternal deaths are those that occur from any cause not related to the pregnancy but worsened by it.

D. Maternal mortality fate and ratio are not the same. Maternal mortality ratio is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, while maternal mortality fate is the proportion of women who die from maternal causes during their reproductive years.

A.  a.	Prepare for resection of the ileum to prevent spread
B.  b.	Resect the ileum and the adjacent jejunum and ascending colon
C.  c.	Refer to the public health specialist for start of anti-TB
D.  d.	To start steroids
E.  e.	Watchful waiting

###Answer:","C. Refer to the public health specialist for start of anti-TB

Rationale:
The most appropriate intervention for a patient with TB of the GIT, particularly with granulomatous lesions denser along the ileum, is to refer the patient to a public health specialist for the start of anti-TB treatment. This is because TB is a systemic infection that primarily requires systemic treatment with anti-TB medications. Surgical intervention, such as resection of the ileum or other parts of the GIT, is usually reserved for cases where there is significant obstruction, perforation, or bleeding that cannot be managed conservatively. Steroids are not typically used as a first-line treatment for TB, and watchful waiting is generally not recommended for active TB infections.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7585358,0.85311294,0.8030493

###Answer:","B. First-line therapy in adults consists of 4 drugs

Rationale:
The first-line therapy for tuberculosis (TB) in adults typically consists of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. This combination is used to treat both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. The tuberculin skin test (TST) is not diagnostic for TB, but rather indicates a previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is available but it is not effective in preventing pulmonary TB in adults.

###Answer:","A. Cryptococcosis is the most likely diagnosis

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with cryptococcosis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals. The butterfly pattern of interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph is a characteristic finding in cryptococcosis. Cryptococcosis is typically treated with antifungal agents such as amphotericin B or fluconazole. Cotrimoxazole is not a first-line therapy for cryptococcosis, and dapsone has no role in the management of this condition.

D.  He should offer IPT (Isoniazid preventive therapy) to HIV patients with cough, fever, and night sweats
E.  He should delay anti-retroviral therapy in HIV/TB co-infected patients till they complete TB therapy

###Answer:","C. N-95 Filter is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation

Rationale:
N-95 respirators are designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. They can block 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. Surgical masks, on the other hand, are designed to protect the patient from the wearer's respiratory droplets, not to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne particles. Therefore, N-95 filters are more effective in preventing aerosol inhalation.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
A. BCG vaccine is not routinely recommended for adults, and its effectiveness in preventing TB is variable.
B. A positive Mantoux test indicates exposure to TB, but it does not indicate excellent protection against TB.
D. IPT is not offered to HIV patients with symptoms of TB. Instead, they should be evaluated for TB and started on TB treatment if TB is diagnosed.

###Answer:","C. Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months

Rationale:
The primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is usually given to HIV patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/uL. However, once the CD4 count remains above 200 cells/uL for more than 6 months, the prophylaxis can be discontinued. This is because the risk of PCP decreases significantly when the immune system is strengthened. The other options are either incorrect or not directly related to the preventive therapy in HIV patients. For example, Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is not universal but rather given to those with CD4 counts below 200 cells/uL or those with certain clinical conditions. Dapsone can be used when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated, but it should not be continued indefinitely. Isoniazid preventive therapy is given to those who have a positive tuberculin skin test or a positive interferon-gamma release assay and are HIV-positive, regardless of TB contact history. Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy is given to those with a CD4 count below 100 cells/uL who have an opportunistic infection or are at high risk of developing one, not when initiating antiretroviral treatment.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7184008,0.8618815,0.7836275

However, a sudden increase in viral load to 245 copies/ml indicates potential drug resistance or treatment failure. A repeat viral load should be done in 6 months to confirm the result. If similar levels are obtained, the patient should be switched to a second-line regimen. An intercurrent infection can cause a temporary increase in viral load but would not be the primary cause in this scenario. Adherence counseling and directly observed treatment are important for maintaining adherence, but they would not address the issue of treatment failure. Laboratory variations and errors are always a consideration, but in this case, the patient's history and the significant increase in viral load suggest that the result is likely accurate. The viremia would not be expected to continue rising with time if the patient is switched to a second-line regimen.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7578705,0.86144453,0.8063451

###Question: With regards to antiretroviral drugs, which of these statements is TRUE?
###Options:
A.  Zidovudine and Abacavir are both thymidine analogs
B.  Dolutegravir has a low genetic barrier to resistance
C.  Enfuvirtide exerts its action by binding to gp41
D.  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can be used to treat both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections
E.  Boosting with ritonavir increases the metabolism of the partner drug, thereby reducing toxicity

###Answer:","D. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can be used to treat both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections

Rationale:
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are a class of antiretroviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme of HIV. They are effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2, which are the two main types of HIV. Examples of NNRTIs include Nevirapine, Efavirenz, and Delavirdine.

A, B, C, and E are incorrect:

A. Zidovudine and Abacavir are both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), not thymidine analogs. Thymidine analogs include Zidovudine, Stavudine, and Lamivudine.

B. Dolutegravir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, not a low one.

C. Enfuvirtide exerts its action by binding to the gp41 protein of HIV-1, not gp41. It is a fusion inhibitor, not an integrase inhibitor.

C.  Secretory
D.  Infective
E.  Dysmotility

###Answer:","C. Secretory

Rationale:
Cholera is a disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The mechanism of diarrhea in cholera is secretory, as the bacteria produce a toxin (cholera toxin) that stimulates the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, leading to profuse, watery diarrhea. This secretory mechanism is different from other types of diarrhea, such as osmotic diarrhea (where water moves into the intestine due to an osmotic gradient) or inflammatory diarrhea (where inflammation in the intestine leads to increased secretion or decreased absorption of fluids). Dysmotility (abnormal motility of the intestine) can also cause diarrhea, but it is not the primary mechanism in cholera. Infective diarrhea refers to diarrhea caused by the presence of pathogens in the intestine, but it does not specifically describe the mechanism by which the diarrhea occurs.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7510615,0.8638629,0.8035226

###Answer:","A. H+, K+ ATPase

Rationale:
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disorder that results in the destruction of parietal cells in the stomach. These cells are responsible for the production of H+, K+ ATPase, an enzyme that helps in the secretion of hydrochloric acid and potassium ions. Anti-parietal cell antibodies are produced in response to this autoimmune attack and are directed against the H+, K+ ATPase enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is A. H+, K+ ATPase.

B.  hypersensitivity response toproducts of TB bacteria
C.  due to expanding granuloma
D.  due to caseous necrosis
E.  direct host cell killing by the bacillus

###Answer:","C. due to expanding granuloma

Rationale:
Mycobacterium TB causes tuberculosis (TB) by inducing a chronic inflammatory response, leading to the formation of granulomas. These granulomas are composed of macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts, which attempt to wall off the TB bacilli. However, the bacilli can persist within these granulomas, leading to a chronic infection. The other options are not the primary causes of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium TB. Impaired antibody response and cell-mediated response are not the causes of TB pathogenicity, but rather consequences of the disease. Hypersensitivity response to products of TB bacteria is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs in some individuals who have been previously infected with TB, but it is not the primary cause of the disease. Direct host cell killing by the bacillus is not the primary cause of TB pathogenicity, as the bacilli are able to persist within host cells without killing them.

###Answer:","C. Cause formation of epithelioid cell granulomas

Rationale:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). It is a slow-growing, aerobic, non-spore forming, non-motile bacillus. When it infects the body, it induces a type 4 hypersensitivity response, not type 2. The infection leads to the formation of epithelioid cell granulomas, which are a characteristic feature of TB lesions.

###Answer:","E. ALT

Rationale:
ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is primarily found in the liver. In acute liver disease, there is a rapid increase in the release of ALT into the bloodstream, while in chronic liver disease, the liver cells are damaged over a longer period, and the ALT levels may not be as high. Therefore, ALT levels can help distinguish acute from chronic liver disease.

AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) is also an enzyme found in the liver, but it is also found in other tissues, so its levels may not be as specific for liver disease. Alkaline phosphatase is more associated with biliary obstruction, not specifically acute or chronic liver disease. Albumin is a protein synthesized by the liver, but its levels can be affected by many factors, not just liver disease.

E.  Does not respond to Metronidazole

###Answer:","C. incubation periods can be from less than 24 hours to > 1month

Rationale:
Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a disease caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The incubation period for tetanus can range from a few days to several months, with an average of about 10 days. This long incubation period is due to the slow growth of the bacteria and the production of the toxin. The spasms of tetanus typically begin in the peripheral muscles and can spread to the trunk and facial muscles. Less than 1% of tetanus cases occur without a wound being identified, and patients who have survived the disease do not confer immunity to others. Tetanus can be treated with tetanus immune globulin and antibiotics such as penicillin or metronidazole.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7423701,0.86544144,0.79919547

E.  Quinine is the first-line drug of choice in uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria

###Answer:","B. P. Faciparum can remain dormant in the intrahepatic cells for months and later activate to cause clinical relapse

Rationale:
The life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria, includes a sexual phase in the mosquito and an asexual phase in the human host. During the asexual phase, the parasite invades red blood cells and multiplies, causing the clinical symptoms of malaria. However, some parasites can invade the liver cells (hepatic parenchymal cells) and remain dormant for months or even years. These dormant parasites are called hypnozoites. When they reactivate, they can cause a clinical relapse of malaria. This is what option B refers to.

Rationale:
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease that is transmitted through the bites of blackflies. The parasite lives in the skin and eyes, and it takes a long time for the parasite to die off once vector control measures are implemented. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vector control alone is not sufficient to eliminate onchocerciasis, and it may take more than 10 years of continued vector control to achieve elimination in a designated region. This is because the parasite has a long life cycle, and it takes time for the parasite to die off in the environment and for the blackflies to be eliminated. In addition, it is important to note that individual treatment of infected individuals is also necessary to achieve elimination of onchocerciasis. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Rationale:
The symptoms described, such as multiple papules, exudative lesions on the face, scalp, trunk, and few vesicles on the palms and soles, along with the history of itchy lesions in the mother, are consistent with infantile seborrheic dermatitis. This condition is common in infants and typically presents with scalp involvement, along with lesions on the face, trunk, and extensor surfaces. Scabies, Stevens Johnson’s Syndrome, infantile eczema, and impetigo contagiosa may present with similar symptoms but have different characteristics that would make them less likely in this case. For example, scabies is characterized by intense itching, especially at night, and a burrow-like rash.

E.  Responds to therapy with Amoxiclav.

###Answer:","B. Cholera toxin produces its effect by reducing intracellular levels of cAMP

Rationale:
Cholera toxin is a potent enterotoxin that causes the secretory diarrhea characteristic of cholera. It achieves this by activating the adenylate cyclase enzyme in the intestinal epithelial cells, leading to an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. However, the increase in cAMP causes an efflux of Cl- ions and water into the intestinal lumen, resulting in a net loss of water and electrolytes from the body. This is the opposite of the usual effect of cAMP, which is to increase intracellular levels of cAMP, and thus the answer is B.

###Answer:","E. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are often kept open for delayed closure, as wound infection inevitably happens, leading to wound dehiscence

Rationale:
Delayed primary closure is not the standard of care for perforation in typhoid fever. The wound is usually closed primarily to prevent contamination of the peritoneal cavity and to reduce the risk of wound infection. If the wound is left open, it increases the risk of wound infection, dehiscence, and herniation. The other options are all correct in the treatment of typhoid perforation. Perforation occurring in the first week of typhoid fever has a better prognosis, treatment involves vigorous resuscitation with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, chloramphenicol is not the drug of choice (ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin is usually used), and several surgical options can be carried out depending on the condition of the patient, the site and number of perforations, and the amount of peritoneal soiling.",E,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7447615,0.86778164,0.801579

Rationale:
The symptoms described, such as the appearance of grey-brown patches in the mouth and skin, darkening of scars, dizziness upon standing (postural hypotension), and a history of travel to a region with high endemicity for certain infectious diseases (Nigeria), are suggestive of Addison's disease. Addison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is characterized by a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone production due to damage or destruction of the adrenal glands. This deficiency can lead to symptoms such as hyperpigmentation, fatigue, and orthostatic hypotension. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone) and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism) can also cause symptoms such as hypertension and hypokalemia, but they are less likely in this case given the other symptoms presented.

D.  Urinary output does not affect the amount per day
E.  1.5 litres of 0.9% Saline is needed per day

###Answer:","E.  1.5 litres of 0.9% Saline is needed per day

Rationale:
The average insensible water loss for an adult is about 0.5 litres per day, which is not enough to maintain fluid balance in a 70 kg African man. The body needs about 2-2.5 litres of water per day to maintain fluid balance. This water can come from both ingested fluids and metabolic water produced during the breakdown of food.

Potassium is an essential electrolyte that the body needs, but the amount needed per day is about 2-4g or 2-3mmol, not litres.

Fluids containing colloids are used for resuscitation or in cases of severe fluid loss, not for maintenance.

Urinary output does affect the amount of fluid needed per day. If the urinary output is high, more fluid is needed to maintain balance.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. 1.5 litres of 0.9% Saline is needed per day. This is an isotonic solution that contains sodium and chloride ions, which are essential electrolytes, and glucose, which acts as a colloid to help maintain fluid balance in the body.",E,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75660926,0.8540866,0.8023983

###Answer:","D. Total body water in the male is 60% of body weight

Rationale:
In the human body, the total body water (TBW) is approximately 60% of body weight in men and 50-55% in women. This distribution is due to the higher amount of fat in women compared to men. The extracellular water (ECW) is about 16% of body weight in men, and the intracellular water (ICW) is about 34% of body weight. The most important extracellular cation is Sodium, not Potassium.

A.  Perinatal causes are commoner than prenatal causes in Africa
B.  Choreoathetoid is the commonest type in Africa
C.  Predominant cause in Nigeria is congenital toxoplasmosis
D.  Cortical atrophy is the basic pathologic manifestation
E.  Mental retardation is a constant feature

###Answer:","A. Perinatal causes are commoner than prenatal causes in Africa

Rationale:
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. In Africa, perinatal causes such as asphyxia, infections, and trauma are more common than prenatal causes like genetic disorders and congenital infections. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Option B is incorrect because the commonest type of cerebral palsy in Africa is spastic, not choreoathetoid.

Option C is incorrect because congenital toxoplasmosis is not a common cause of cerebral palsy in Nigeria.

Option D is incorrect because cortical atrophy is a pathologic manifestation of some types of cerebral palsy, but it is not the basic pathologic manifestation of all types.

Option E is incorrect because mental retardation is not a constant feature of cerebral palsy. It depends on the severity and location of the brain damage. Some individuals with cerebral palsy may have normal or above-average intelligence.",A,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7422046,0.85323405,0.79385597

###Answer:","B. Staphylococcus specie is the commonest aetiology

Rationale:
Pyogenic meningitis, also known as bacterial meningitis, is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. While the infection can spread through various routes, including direct extension from the middle ear, the haematogenous route is also a common source of infection.

Rationale:
Concealed haemorrhages, or intracranial haemorrhages, are a common cause of hyperbilirubinaemia in term Nigerian babies due to the high prevalence of difficult deliveries and birth asphyxia in this population. This condition leads to the breakdown of red blood cells, releasing bilirubin into the bloodstream, causing an increase in bilirubin levels (hyperbilirubinaemia).

###Answer:","B. Both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation.

Rationale:
Sickle cell disease is a recessive disorder, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to have the disease. This is in contrast to autosomal dominant disorders, where a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease. The most common variant of sickle cell disease is due to a point mutation in the sixth codon of the beta-globin gene, leading to the substitution of valine for glutamic acid, which is a missense mutation, not a nonsense mutation.

###Question: WRITE A SHORT NOTE ON THE WAYS OF PREVENTING ACUTE DIARRHEA DISEASE IN MOTHERS AND CHILDREN IN LAGOS STATE NIGERIA 
###Options:

###Answer:","A

Rationale:

Option A provides a comprehensive list of preventive measures for acute diarrhea disease in mothers and children in Lagos State, Nigeria. These measures include:

1. Proper and regular hand washing with soap and clean water. This is crucial to prevent the spread of pathogens that cause diarrhea.

2. Safe water and food preparation. Boiling water and ensuring food is properly cooked can help eliminate harmful bacteria and parasites.

3. Proper disposal of waste and feces. This helps prevent contamination of the environment and water sources.

4. Breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life provides immunity to the baby against many diseases, including diarrhea.

5. Vaccination. Regular vaccination, especially for rotavirus, can help prevent diarrhea.

6. Good hygiene practices. This includes keeping the environment clean, especially the areas where food is prepared and stored.

7. Adequate nutrition. A balanced diet helps strengthen the immune system and prevent diseases like diarrhea.

8. Use of safe and clean water for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene.

These measures are essential in reducing the incidence of acute diarrhea disease in mothers and children in Lagos State, Nigeria.",A,True,0.1712062207361203,0.016260157636916638,0.15564201840148997,0.8343735,0.81018615,0.82210195

###Options:
A.  Sarcoidosis
B.  Tuberculosis
C.  Surgery
D.  Severe blood loss during child birth

###Answer:","B. Tuberculosis

Rationale:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a common cause of hypopituitarism in developing countries due to the high prevalence of the disease in these regions. TB can cause hypopituitarism by directly invading the pituitary gland or by causing inflammation and compression of the gland. Sarcoidosis, while a cause of hypopituitarism, is less common in developing countries. Surgery and severe blood loss during childbirth can also cause hypopituitarism, but they are less common causes in developing countries compared to TB.",B,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7549362,0.852708,0.80084896

###Options:
A.  Pulmonary oedema
B.  Acute renal insufficiency
C.  Haemoglobinuria
D.  Hyperbilirubinaemia

###Answer:","C. Haemoglobinuria

Rationale:
Haemoglobinuria is a common complication of severe malaria, caused by the lysis of red blood cells (RBCs) infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The lysis of RBCs releases haemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can be detected in the urine as a dark brown or red colour. This is known as ""blackwater fever."" The other options are not directly related to the complications of malaria in a 2-year-old child.

###Answer:","E. The majority are epithelial in origin.

Rationale:
Epithelial carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer, accounting for about 90% of all ovarian cancers. The other options are incorrect because ovarian cancer is more common in developed countries, the incidence of ovarian cancer is lower than that of endometrial cancer, the peak age for ovarian cancer is around 63 years old, and the mainstay of treatment is surgery followed by chemotherapy, not radiotherapy.",E,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7746175,0.8594347,0.8148248

###Options:
A.  Sickle cell anaemia.
B.  Iron deficiency
C.  Glucose-6- Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency.
D.  Septicaemia.

###Answer:","B. Iron deficiency

Rationale:
The haematocrit (Hct) is the proportion of red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood. A normal Hct in adults is 40-54% for men and 36-48% for women. In children, the Hct is lower, and the range varies with age. However, a range of 23% to 26% is significantly lower than the normal range for children and is indicative of anaemia. The most common cause of anaemia in children in developing countries, including Nigeria, is iron deficiency due to poor diet and malnutrition. Sickle cell anaemia, Glucose-6- Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and septicaemia can also cause anaemia, but their haematocrit levels are usually lower than 23%.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73657084,0.86295044,0.7947679

Rationale: Tetanus toxoid is a vaccine that provides immunity against tetanus, a bacterial disease that causes painful muscle contractions and stiffness, especially in newborns. The other options (Pentavalent I, II and III, Anti-Tetanus serum, and Measles) are not effective in the prevention of neonatal tetanus.

###Answer:","D. Gastric lavage

Rationale:
Gastric lavage is a procedure used to empty the stomach, which is contraindicated in cases of ingestion of petroleum products like kerosene due to the risk of aspiration and chemical pneumonitis. The other options (A, B, and C) are not contraindicated in this scenario. Cardiac positioning is used to improve venous return and oxygenation, venous cannula insertion is used to administer fluids and medications, and activated charcoal is used to adsorb toxins in the gastrointestinal tract.
