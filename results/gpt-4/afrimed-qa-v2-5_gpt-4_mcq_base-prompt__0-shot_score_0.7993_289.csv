###Options:
A.  steady state hemoglobin
B.  blood transfusion
C.  intravenous fluids
D.  folic acid supplementation
E.  malaria prophylaxis

###Answer:","E. Malaria prophylaxis

Rationale: Patients with sickle cell anemia are potentially at an increased risk of severe malaria infections, therefore malaria prophylaxis is beneficial in a malaria-endemic country like Nigeria. While blood transfusions and hydration management (intravenous fluids) can be part of management for crisis episodes in sickle cell disease, these are not necessarily a part of steady state management. Folic acid supplementation can support the production of red blood cells, but this doesn't directly manage sickle cell anemia. Steady-state hemoglobin is an outcome measure or a state, not a management strategy. Therefore, malaria prophylaxis can be viewed as valid steady-state management because it helps to prevent a potential crisis trigger.",E,False,0.1702127634223631,0.016949150451020085,0.1276595719330014,0.8115023,0.8688567,0.8392007

###Rationale:
In acute exacerbation of asthma, the mainstay of treatment is quick-acting bronchodilator such as Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs). SABAs work quickly to relax the muscles around the airways that have contracted during an asthma attack, thus allowing the patient to breathe again. This makes SABAs the first choice in acute asthma management.

###Answer:","C. Surgical debridement and irrigation

###Rationale:
The primary goal in managing a large, infected wound is to control the infection and prevent it from spreading. This is usually achieved through wound debridement, which involves removing infected or dead tissue, and wound irrigation, which uses fluid to assist in wound cleaning. Option A, while potentially helpful, may not be sufficient in managing a large, infected wound. Option B might be needed but the wound still requires cleaning and debridement. Option D is far too drastic as a first line of management for an infected wound and should be considered only when all other options have failed or in case of severe systemic illness due to this infection. Option E, while being conservative, may not be efficient enough if the wound is heavily infected.

The symptoms described by the patient: persistent cough, fever, and fatigue are common to several conditions. While these symptoms suggest the possibility of a respiratory condition such as pneumonia or tuberculosis (which is prevalent in Africa), they could be manifestations of several other diseases. Therefore, before jumping to conclusions, further information should be gathered. Making a diagnosis simply based on these three symptoms without additional information is premature. A physical examination and more detailed history from the patient are needed to help narrow down the possible diagnoses and guide next steps. This could eventually lead to the need for further diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray or a referral to a specialist if needed, but these are not the immediate next steps.

E.  Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint

###Answer:","C. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction

###Rationale: 
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) provides stability to the knee and prevents the lower leg from sliding too far forward. When it is torn, one of the most common treatment options is arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. In this procedure, the surgeon uses a graft to replace the torn ACL. This is usually done on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia. It is preferred over conservative management, knee brace, corticosteroid injection or open ACL repair as it corrects the instability, has a faster recovery time, less risk of infection and provides better outcome.

###Question: About >80% of the people globally affected by schistosomiasis live in Africa.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","A. True

###Rationale: 
Schistosomiasis is a major public health issue in many African countries, with more than 200 million people infected worldwide, and over 80% of these cases are concentrated in Africa according to the World Health Organization. The disease is prevalent due to the presence of its intermediate host, certain types of freshwater snails, which thrive in many African water bodies.

###Answer:","A. Osteoarthritis

###Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of progressive hip pain, stiffness, and limited motion, along with imaging findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation are classic signs of osteoarthritis. While elevated levels of serum uric acid are typically associated with gout, it can sometimes be present in osteoarthritis. It is essential to relate the laboratory findings with the clinical signs and imaging findings. Gout, on the other hand, tends to present as acute inflammatory arthritis affecting smaller joints first. Rheumatoid arthritis also primarily affects smaller joints and presents bilaterally, Avascular necrosis might present similarly but imaging would probably show bone change indicative of necrosis.

###Rationale:
Pellagra is a disorder caused by a deficiency of niacin, also known as vitamin B3. Its symptoms often include symmetric pigmented patches on the skin, along with digestive issues and cognitive difficulties. This disorder is common in African populations where diets are often the most deficient in niacin. On the other hand, Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency, Kwashiorkor by insufficient protein intake, Beriberi by vitamin B1 deficiency, and Vitiligo is not a nutritional deficiency disorder – it's an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks the pigment cells in the skin.",C,True,0.17777777432098768,0.017699112246848277,0.1333333298765433,0.8311077,0.87907904,0.85442054

C.  Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
D.  Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury
E.  Meniscus tear

###Answer:","C. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury

###Rationale:
The anterior drawer test is a clinical test used to evaluate injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It has a higher sensitivity and specificity for ACL injuries than for other knee ligament injuries. The findings of acute knee pain, swelling, and a positive anterior drawer test after a twisting injury are consistent with an ACL tear. Thus, option C is the most appropriate diagnosis.

###Answer:","A. Confusion and sleep disturbances

###Rationale:
African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, goes through two stages: the first, or early stage, affects the blood and lymph systems, while the second, or neurological stage, affects the brain and spinal cord. The neurological stage of the disease often features symptoms such as confusion and sleep disturbances, making option A the correct answer. Symptoms like fever and chills usually occur in the early stage of the disease, while jaundice and hepatomegaly (option C) are not typical symptoms.

###Rationale: 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in many parts of Africa and is a well-established etiological factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of primary liver cancer.

###Options:
A.  Malaria
B.  Family history of sickle cell disease
C.  Vitamin D deficiency
D.  Hemoglobin AS genotype
E.  Hemoglobin AC genotype

###Answer:","C. Vitamin D deficiency

###Rationale: 
Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the HBB gene, which codes for the beta chain of hemoglobin protein. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning it only develops in an individual if they have two mutant alleles. The main risk factor for this disease is having two parents with sickle cell trait (Hemoglobin AS or Hemoglobin AC genotype) or sickle cell disease themselves, thus a family history of sickle cell disease (option B). 

Malaria (option A) is a risk factor because people with sickle cell trait can have some protection against severe malaria due to the shape of their red blood cells, hence there's prevalence in malaria-endemic regions like Nigeria. Hemoglobin AS genotype and Hemoglobin AC genotype (options D and E) are sickle cell traits carried by people, making their offspring at risk if both parents are carriers.

Vitamin D deficiency (option C) is not a direct risk factor for the disease. While it may contribute to bone-related complications in those already with the disease, it does not itself cause or heighten the risk of the disease. It's rather a factor in disease complications not the actual cause of sickle cell disease.",C,False,0.20895522200935623,0.09278350390424063,0.20895522200935623,0.8070413,0.8965196,0.84943056

###Answer:","B. Aqueous mecurochrome

###Rationale: 
Omphalocele is a birth defect where an infant's intestine or other abdominal organs are outside of the body because of a hole in the belly button area. Non-operative management of major omphalocele in Nigeria mostly involves the usage of aqueous mecurochrome, a type of antiseptic, for dressing the exposed intestines and aiding in secondary epithelialization. It is painted on the omphalocele sac in the first couple days of life and continued until complete epithelialisation occurs. The remaining options like Dermazine cream + sufratulle, honey, alcohol and vaseline impregnated with penicillin are not standard practices for major omphalocele non-operative management.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, often presents initially with painless skin lesions. The disease affects the skin and nerves, and these lesions can be discolored or raised. As the disease progresses, patients may also experience numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, but these are not the initial symptoms. Loss of eyebrows (option A) and red, swollen eyes (option D) are more common in lepromatous leprosy, a different form of the disease. Enlarged lymph nodes (option C) are more often seen in conditions such as lymphoma and certain infections but are not a common presentation of leprosy.

###Answer:","A. Intramuscular midazolam

###Rationale: 
The initial treatment for status epilepticus should be rapid-acting and easy to administer. While all of the options given are potential treatments for seizures, the question specifies 'resource-limited' which suggests the need for ease of administration and accessibility. Intramuscular (IM) midazolam best fits these criteria because it is easily administered, does not require IV access (which may be difficult or time-consuming to establish, especially in resource-limited settings), and is highly effective.

###Answer:","A. Aortic regurgitation

###Rationale:
Infective endocarditis often affects the surface of heart valves, particularly the aortic and mitral valves. Over time, this infection can lead to valve damage and cause regurgitation (a condition where blood flows back through the valve when it should not), making Options A and B reasonable considerations. A comparison of the relative prevalence of these two complications in the setting of infective endocarditis generally reveals aortic regurgitation as more common, particularly in individuals with pre-existing structural heart abnormalities or prosthetic valves. Thus, Aortic regurgitation (option A) is chosen over Mitral Regurgitation (option B).

Uterine rupture, though it is quite rare, is considered a major obstetric emergency, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where the rates of cesarean section are comparatively high. This condition can occur during labor in women who previously had a cesarean section. The rates of uterine rupture in Africa, unlike in high-income countries, are dangerously high because of limited access to routine obstetric care, comprehensive emergency obstetric services, and skilled birth attendants. Although all the listed conditions can cause obstetric emergencies, consuming evidence points to uterine rupture as a grave concern in Africa.",B,False,0.18181817767574746,0.016528921890582086,0.18181817767574746,0.8376585,0.83844686,0.8380525

###Question: In the management of status epilepticus the following drugs may be given intravenously in Nigeria:
###Options:
A.  Hydralazine
B.  Phenytoin sodium
C.  Amiodarone
D.  Paraldehyde
E.  Carbamazepine

###Answer:","B. Phenytoin sodium

###Rationale: 
Status epilepticus is a persistent or recurrent seizure without regaining consciousness, which sometimes poses a medical emergency. It is primarily managed using drugs that work as anticonvulsants - they exert their effect by reducing the excessive and rapid firing of neurons that cause the seizures. Phenytoin sodium (Option B) is one such anticonvulsant that can be administered intravenously. Other drugs like hydralazine (Option A) and amiodarone (Option C) are used for managing hypertension and irregular heart rhythms respectively, whereas paraldehyde (Option D) is an old treatment primarily used for acute alcohol withdrawal, but rarely used today due to side effects. Carbamazepine (Option E) is an anticonvulsant and mood stablizer, but usually not given intravenously, it needs a slower start to prevent side effects. Thus, in the context of management of status epilepticus in Nigeria, Phenytoin sodium is the most appropriate drug among the provided options.",B,True,0.11570247768595043,0.03921568505275753,0.11570247768595043,0.7877451,0.868692,0.82624066

###Answer:","A. Hemorrhage

###Rationale: 
Although all the provided options can cause maternal mortality, hemorrhage, specifically postpartum hemorrhage, is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa according to multiple studies and the World Health Organization. It is responsible for about 34% of maternal deaths in this region. This is due to a variety of factors including the high prevalence of anemia among women, lack of access to quality medical care, and limited resources for managing obstetric emergencies.",A,True,0.26415093846030624,0.0775193749774656,0.26415093846030624,0.8581313,0.8538805,0.8560006

###Answer:","A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)

###Rationale: 
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells by autoantibodies. This results in normocytic anemia, the symptoms of which include fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea—exactly the symptoms described in the patient. A positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is a reliable test to confirm AIHA. Thrombocytopenia is not a typical feature of AIHA, but it can occur due to concurrent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in a condition sometimes called Evans syndrome.

B.  Cri-du-chat syndrome
C.  Turner syndrome
D.  Fragile X syndrome
E.  Prader-Willi syndrome

###Answer:","B. Cri-du-chat syndrome

###Rationale:
Cri-du-chat syndrome, also known as ""cat's cry"" syndrome, is characterized by a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p). The condition is named after the distinctive cry of affected infants, which is similar to that of a meowing kitten. In addition to the high-pitched cry, symptoms can include developmental delay, microcephaly (small head size), and facial deformities. None of the other options listed are associated with a deletion on chromosome 5p. Furthermore, each of these conditions is characterized by different sets of symptoms and genetic abnormalities. For instance, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21, Turner syndrome by a missing or altered X chromosome, Fragile X syndrome by a mutation on the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, and Prader-Willi syndrome by deletion or disruption of genes on the paternal chromosome 15.

###Options:
A.  Radiations
B.  Chemicals
C.  Scald
D.  Flame
E.  Electricity

###Answer:","D. Flame

###Rationale: 
In Nigeria, the most common cause of burns is flame mainly due to open fire cooking methods, inadequate safety measures around fire, as well as incidents of fire outbreaks due to poor electrical installations and petrol fires. Therefore, flame is the most common agent responsible for burns in this context. Other choices like radiations, chemicals, scald, and electricity, while they can cause burns, are less common in comparison.",D,True,0.06666666542222224,0.0,0.06666666542222224,0.8009318,0.8615477,0.8301347

###Answer:","E. Tuberculosis

###Rationale:
Tuberculosis is the most common cause of chronic cough in Africa due to the high prevalence of the disease in this location. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified Africa as having one of the highest incidence rates of tuberculosis globally.

###Answer:","A. plasmodium falciparum

###Rationale: 
Plasmodium falciparum is the most common and the most deadly type of malaria parasite in Africa. According to the World Health Organization, it's responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally.

###Question: A 39-year-old Ghanaian was diagnosed with TB of the GIT. The granulomatous lesions appeared to be denser along the ileum. What is the most appropriate intervention for this patient 
###Options:
A.  a.	Prepare for resection of the ileum to prevent spread
B.  b.	Resect the ileum and the adjacent jejunum and ascending colon
C.  c.	Refer to the public health specialist for start of anti-TB
D.  d.	To start steroids
E.  e.	Watchful waiting

###Answer:","C. Refer to the public health specialist for start of anti-TB

###Rationale:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infectious disease that is treated with a specific regimen of anti-TB medications typically including isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Surgery is rarely necessary and is not the first line of treatment for the disease. Steroids are not generally used unless there are TB-related complications such as tuberculous meningitis, pericarditis, or miliary TB. Watchful waiting is inappropriate as TB is a serious, progressive disease that, left untreated, can lead to serious complications and death. The involvement of a public health specialist is important in the initiation and management of treatment, as well as for contact tracing and other public health interventions.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7418382,0.862089,0.79745585

C.  c.	Rarity of precancerous lesions like Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis
D.  d.	All the above
E.  e.	None of the above

###Answer:","D. All the above

###Rationale:
All options (A, B, and C) are factors contributing to the relatively lower frequency of colorectal cancers in Africa. 

A. The relatively young population in Africa: Colorectal cancer has a higher incidence in older people, thus a younger population may have less occurrence of the disease.
 
B. Large intake of high fibre diet which shortens the transit time of faeces: A high fiber diet can facilitate better bowel movement, reducing the time the bowel is in contact with potential carcinogens thus reducing the possibility of colorectal cancer. 

C. Rarity of precancerous lesions like Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis: These diseases are known risk factors for colorectal cancer and are less common in Africa, thus potentially bringing down the incidence of colorectal cancers. 

Therefore, all these factors could contribute to a relative decrease in colorectal cancer cases in Africa, hence option D is correct.",D,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7422029,0.8431824,0.78947675

###Answer:","C. Sigmoid volvulus

###Rationale:
Sigmoid volvulus, a condition where the sigmoid colon twists on its mesenteric base, is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction in Africa. The sigmoid colon's elongated shape and mobility in the lower abdomen allow it to twist more easily, leading to obstruction. This is prevalent in Africa, particularly in rural areas, due to long-standing dietary habits of consuming high-fiber meals, which lead to a longer, more mobile sigmoid colon, prone to volvulus.

###Answer:","A. Strangulated inguinal hernia

###Rationale: 
Strangulated inguinal hernia is noted as a common cause of small bowel obstruction worldwide but especially prevalent in Ghana due to factors such as delayed presentation to the hospital and the commonality of this type of hernia in the population. Intussusception tends to be the most common in children. Band and adhesions, while common in post-surgical patients, are not the leading cause.

###Question: The commonest site for extrapulmonary tuberculosis is?
###Options:
A.  Cervical lymph nodes
B.  Pleura
C.  Meninges
D.  Bone
E.  Miliary TB

###Answer:","A. Cervical lymph nodes

###Rationale: 
Extrapulmonary tuberculosis refers to tuberculosis that occurs outside of the lungs. Although it can occur in any part of the body, the most common site is the cervical lymph nodes, also known as tuberculous lymphadenitis or scrofula. This is because the lymphatic system, which includes the cervical lymph nodes, is responsible for filtering and removing harmful substances, including bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. Therefore, these nodes can become primary sites of infection in extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

###Rationale:
The Widal test is primarily used to diagnose Typhoid fever, not cholera. Cholera diagnosis is mainly through stool culture. Other options relate to cholera truthfully. For instance, cholera is often described as having a 'rice water' stool because of its pale, milky appearance. It can lead to acute kidney injury due to severe dehydration.

###Rationale: 
Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. The urinary tract or the intestines may be infected. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. 

Option A, 'Ground' itch, is a form of dermatitis that occurs when the schistosomal cercariae penetrate the skin. 
Option B, Hepatomegaly, means an enlarged liver, which can result from schistosomiasis. 
Option C, Bladder cancer, is a possible long term effect of urinary schistosomiasis.

D.  Tuberculous lymphadenitis explains the findings
E.  Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

###Answer:","E. Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

###Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are most suggestive of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), a common and serious opportunistic infection in people with HIV. Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is the first-line treatment for PJP, not second-line to macrolides. Dapsone, atovaquone, or pentamidine can be used in cases of intolerance or allergy to cotrimoxazole. Cryptococcosis and tuberculous lymphadenitis do not typically present with a bilateral peri-hilar infiltrate in a butterfly pattern.

###Answer:","C. Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months

###Rationale: 
While all the options are related to HIV prophylaxis treatment schemes, only option C is universally accepted. This is because primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) can indeed be discontinued once the patient's CD4 count has been stably above 200 cells/uL for at least six months, given the low likelihood of developing this opportunistic infection at that point. The statements in the other options are not always true or recommended.

###Question: A patient who has been on antiretrovirals for 6 years and who has maintained undetectable viral loads with his first-line regimen presents with an HIV-RNA viral load of 245 copies/ml. Which of the following is TRUE?
###Options:
A.  An intercurrent infection can cause this
B.  He should have adherence counseling and directly observed treatment and repeat the viral load in a year
C.  A repeat viral load should be done in 6 months and if similar levels are obtained, he should be switched to a second-line regimen
D.  The viremia would be expected to continue rising with time
E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","A. An intercurrent infection can cause this

###Rationale:
A temporary increase in viral load can occur due to intercurrent infections or immunizations, thus if a patient who has been on antiretrovirals for 6 years and has had undetectable viral loads suddenly presents with a detectable viral load, it could be due to an intercurrent infection. Adherence counseling and repeating the viral load within a year (option B) seems too long. Repeating in 6 months (option C) might also not necessary if there's another reason such as intercurrent infection. The statement that the viremia would continue to rise (option D) cannot be concluded on a single reading, and dismissing laboratory variations and errors (option E) is imprudent as they can occur.

###Rationale: 
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition associated with a vitamin B12 deficiency. It is due to the body's failure to absorb vitamin B12 in the stomach because of a lack of intrinsic factor produced by parietal cells. These cells are also responsible for the secretion of gastric acid via the H+, K+ ATPase enzyme system, which is the target of anti-parietal cell antibodies in this disease.

###Answer:","D. due to caseous necrosis

###Rationale:
The pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is largely due to the caseous necrosis. Caseous necrosis is a form of cell death in which the tissue maintains a cheese-like appearance. This phenomenon is mainly triggered by the cell-mediated immune response to the bacterium, leading to the formation of a granuloma (a mass of immune cells) around the invaders. These immune responses cause tissue damage and necrosis, leading to the characteristic symptoms of tuberculosis.

###Answer:","C. Parasites mature in RBCs

###Rationale: 
Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts. During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host. These sporozoites then travel to the liver, invade the liver cells, and mature into schizonts, which rupture and release merozoites. It is these released merozoites that invade red blood cells and mature into trophozoites, schizonts, or gametocytes, respectively.

In contrast, in chronic liver disease, albumin levels will typically be significantly lower due to the liver's diminished ability to produce albumin over time. Thus, albumin is a more reliable marker for distinguishing between acute and chronic liver disease. Our liver makes albumin, and a low level may show that the liver isn't performing well.

###Answer:","C. incubation periods can be from less than 24 hours to > 1 month

###Rationale:
Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, has an incubation period that can range from as little as 24 hours to more than a month. This is the period between the infection by the bacteria Clostridium tetani and the appearance of the first symptoms. The other options - A and B, are incorrect because the spasm usually starts in the jaw and neck muscles and not in the periphery or trunk, and less than 30%, not 1%, of tetanus occurs without a known wound.

###Answer:","B. P. Faciparum can remain dormant in the intrahepatic cells for months and later activate to cause clinical relapse

###Rationale:
This statement is correct. Plasmodium falciparum, as well as other species of plasmodium such as P. vivax and P. ovale, can form dormant stages (hypnozoites) in the liver that can reactivate months or even years later, leading to a clinical relapse. This is a key aspect of the life cycle of these plasmodium species, and a big challenge in the elimination of malaria, as treatment must kill these dormant stages to prevent relapses. The other options are incorrect. For instance, the clinical symptoms don't begin when the sporozoites invade the liver cells (Option A), but rather when the parasites invade the red blood cells.

###Answer:","A. Leprosy

###Rationale: 
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract. One of the complications of leprosy is damage to the facial nerves, including the orbicularis oculi, a muscle that controls eyelid closure. Paresis (partial paralysis) of this muscle can lead to lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely), and if the cornea loses sensation, it can become damaged and potentially lead to blindness.

###Answer:","A. they usually do not multiply in the host

###Rationale:

###Answer:","E. More than 10 years

###Rationale:
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic infection transmitted by blackfly vectors. Since the reproductive lifespan of the adult onchocerca worm is about 10-15 years, vector control needs to be sustained beyond this period to ensure all adult worms die off naturally in infected individuals.

###Rationale: 
Most of these options are factually true to some extent, but the most directly related to the topic specific to Africa and HIV is option A. Scientific studies have shown a link between male circumcision and a reduced risk of HIV infection in Africa, where heterosexual spread is the predominant mode of transmission.

###Answer:","B. Strangulated inguinal hernia

###Rationale: 
In Nigeria, Strangulated inguinal hernia is reported as the most frequent cause of intestinal obstruction. This condition occurs when a part of the intestine becomes trapped in the inguinal canal, leading to a blockage.

###Answer:","B. Tetralogy of Fallot

###Rationale: 
Tetralogy of Fallot, an example of a complex congenital heart defect, can lead to congestive cardiac failure in children, not only in Nigeria but globally.

###Answer:","D. G6PD deficiency

###Rationale:
G6PD deficiency is a common cause of neonatal anemia in Nigeria. It is a genetic disorder that mostly affects males and can lead to hemolysis, or destruction of red blood cells, resulting in anemia. Unlike the other conditions in the list, G6PD deficiency is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, due to its protection against malaria. Hence, among the options given, it stands a greater chance of causing neonatal anemia in that region.

D.  Cortical atrophy is the basic pathologic manifestation
E.  Mental retardation is a constant feature

###Answer:","A. Perinatal causes are commoner than prenatal causes in Africa

###Rationale: 
Cerebral palsy in Africa is frequently associated with perinatal conditions such as birth asphyxia, neonatal jaundice, and infections. These often result from issues like late or non-attendance of antenatal care, home deliveries without skilled birth attendants, and traditional practices. Prenatal causes are less common due to limited data and lack of proper diagnostic facilities.

###Answer:","D. Drug of choice is intravenous artesunate

###Rationale:
Cerebral malaria is a severe form of malaria affecting the brain. The treatment of choice for severe malaria, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is intravenous or intramuscular artesunate until the patient can tolerate oral medication. While cerebral malaria can affect individuals of all ages and not just those between 6-10 years (Option A), convulsions and altered sensorium (confusion or altered consciousness) are not constant features, but they can occur (making Options B and C incorrect).

###Answer:","A.  BCG, OPV0 and Hepatitis B vaccine are administered at birth

###Rationale:
The correct answer is option A because BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), OPV0 (Oral Polio Vaccine), and Hepatitis B vaccines are indeed administered at birth. This is a part of the World Health Organization's immunization schedule to protect newborns from tuberculosis (BCG), polio (OPV0), and hepatitis B. The other options are incorrect; pentavalent vaccine is given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, but rotavirus vaccine is usually given earlier than stated in option C.

###Answer:","B. Cough and breathlessness are common manifestations

###Rationale: 
In cases of kerosene poisoning, the most common manifestations include cough and breathlessness. This is due to kerosene's damaging effect on the lungs, causing chemical pneumonitis. School age children might consume kerosene out of curiosity, but there isn't enough evidence to state that they are most at risk.

###Answer:","C. Chronic otalgia is a risk factor

###Rationale: 
Pyogenic meningitis can be caused by bacterial infections that spread from the ear (especially after prolonged, untreated ear infections, hence the chronic otalgia), sinuses, or throat through the bloodstream to the meninges. Neither Haematogenous spread being the only source of infection (option A) nor Staphylococcus specie being the most common causative organism (option B) is correct. The most common organisms are usually Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. There is no decrease in CSF production in pyogenic meningitis, making option D incorrect.

Option D is the correct answer because viral meningitis is a well-known complication of measles.

Tuberculosis (Option A) is a separate infectious disease, primarily affecting the lungs, not usually associated as a complication of measles. 

Paresthesia (Option B), while it can be caused by a variety of conditions, is not a typical complication of measles.

Heart failure (Option C) can occur as a complication of other diseases, such as those that damage or overwork the heart muscle, but it does not typically result from measles.

In malaria, the Plasmodium parasite infects and ruptures red blood cells leading to haemolysis. The breakdown of red blood cells releases free haemoglobin, which is metabolized into bilirubin. Excessive bilirubin in the blood results in hyperbilirubinaemia, leading to jaundice, a common clinical finding in severe malaria.

###Rationale: 
Although ovarian cancer occurs worldwide, there is no clear evidence that it is most common in developing countries, ruling out Option A.

The peak incidence of ovarian cancer is typically in women older than 50, but the peak age is not as high as 80-90 years old, ruling out Option C. While surgery is a mainstay of treatment for ovarian cancer, the role of radiotherapy is more limited compared to chemotherapy, particularly for epithelial ovarian cancers, ruling out Option D.

###Answer:","B. Iron deficiency

###Rationale: 
Low hematocrit levels commonly indicate anemia, and the most prevalent cause of anemia worldwide is iron deficiency. Iron is needed to make hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood. In rural areas, a common cause for iron deficiency is inadequate nutrition. Although the other options (sickle cell anemia and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) can also cause low hematocrit levels, they are not as prevalent as iron deficiency.

###Answer:","B. Request a Chest X-ray.

###Rationale:
A tuberculin skin test (TST) or Mantoux test result of 10mm or greater is considered positive in children less than 4 years old, individuals with certain medical conditions, or people who have had recent close contact with a person with TB. Chronic cough is a common symptom of tuberculosis, hence, the positive tuberculin test result in a 10-year-old female with chronic cough is a concern. To confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, a chest X-ray is warranted because it can reveal abnormal changes suggestive of TB. Option A, C and D are not the immediate next step in this scenario. An elevation in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate can be seen in many diseases and is non-specific.
