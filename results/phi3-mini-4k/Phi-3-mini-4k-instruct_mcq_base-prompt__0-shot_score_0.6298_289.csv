###Answer:","C. D-Dimer.

Rationale:
In the case of a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy, the most appropriate investigations are those that can directly visualize or detect the presence of a clot. A V/Q scan (A) and CTPA (E) are both imaging tests that can help identify a PE. A CXR (B) can show signs of a PE, such as a wedge-shaped infiltrate or a pleural effusion. An ECG (D) can show signs of right heart strain, which can be indicative of a PE.

However, a D-Dimer test (C) is not appropriate in this case because it is a nonspecific test that can be elevated in many conditions, including pregnancy itself. Pregnancy causes a hypercoagulable state, which can lead to false-positive results on a D-Dimer test.

The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, joint pain, and a rash, combined with her recent travel history to a rural area in West Africa, are indicative of malaria. Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that is prevalent in many parts of Africa. The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

A. Dengue fever: Although dengue fever is also a mosquito-borne disease, it is more common in tropical and subtropical regions, such as Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.

C. Lyme disease: Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. It is not endemic to West Africa.

D. Yellow fever: Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. While it is found in West Africa, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with malaria.

E. Zika virus: Zika virus is also transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause fever, rash, and joint pain. However, it is more commonly associated with pregnant women and the risk of birth defects.

###Question: A 45-year-old African patient presents with a history of chronic knee pain, swelling, and instability, worse with physical activity. Physical examination reveals joint laxity and a positive Lachman test. Imaging reveals a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option?
###Options:
A.  Conservative management with physical therapy
B.  Open ACL repair
C.  Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction
D.  Knee brace immobilization
E.  Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint

###Answer:","C. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a torn ACL, which is a common sports-related injury. The most appropriate treatment option for a torn ACL in an active individual is arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. This minimally invasive surgical procedure involves replacing the torn ligament with a graft, usually taken from the patient's own patellar tendon or hamstring tendon. This procedure has a high success rate and can help restore stability to the knee joint, allowing the patient to return to their previous level of activity.

Conservative management with physical therapy (Option A) may be considered for patients with a partial tear or those who are not physically active, but it is not the best option for this patient, who has a complete tear and requires stability for their daily activities. Open ACL repair (Option B) is an older technique that is less commonly used now due to the advantages of arthroscopic surgery. Knee brace immobilization (Option D) may provide temporary relief but does not address the underlying issue of the torn ACL. Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint (Option E) may help with inflammation and pain but does not repair the torn ligament.",C,True,0.1379310322054697,0.0292682909220703,0.12413792875719384,0.82196915,0.89019275,0.8547217

###Options:
A.  Malaria
B.  Family history of sickle cell disease
C.  Vitamin D deficiency
D.  Hemoglobin AS genotype
E.  Hemoglobin AC genotype

###Answer:","C. Vitamin D deficiency

Rationale:
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects the hemoglobin in red blood cells, causing them to become misshapen and break down prematurely. The risk factors for SCD in Nigeria include malaria, family history of SCD, and certain hemoglobin genotypes.

A. Malaria: Malaria is a significant risk factor for SCD in Nigeria because the sickle cell trait (HbAS) provides some protection against malaria. This has led to a higher prevalence of the sickle cell trait in regions with high malaria transmission, such as Nigeria.

B. Family history of sickle cell disease: SCD is an inherited disorder, meaning that having a family history of the disease increases the risk of developing it.

D. Hemoglobin AS genotype: The sickle cell trait (HbAS) is a common genotype in Nigeria, and individuals with this genotype have a higher risk of developing SCD if they inherit another abnormal hemoglobin gene from their other parent.

E. Hemoglobin AC genotype: The hemoglobin AC genotype (HbAC) is another common genotype in Nigeria. Individuals with this genotype have a milder form of SCD, known as sickle cell trait (HbAS), which can still increase the risk of developing SCD if they inherit another abnormal hemoglobin gene from their other parent.

C. Vitamin D deficiency: While vitamin D deficiency can have various negative health effects, it is not a direct risk factor for SCD. Therefore, it is the correct answer to the question.",C,False,0.2028985489014913,0.09045226008535139,0.2028985489014913,0.7994107,0.8884943,0.8416016

###Options:
A.  alcohol
B.  aqueous mecurochrome
C.  Dermazine cream+sufratulle
D.  Honey
E.  vaseline impregnated with penicillin

###Answer:","C. Dermazine cream + Sufratulle

Rationale:
Omphalocele is a congenital defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs protrude outside of the belly through the belly button. Non-operative management of omphalocele in Nigeria involves the use of Dermazine cream and Sufratulle.

Dermazine cream is a topical antibiotic that helps prevent infection in the exposed organs. Sufratulle is a topical antifungal cream that helps prevent fungal infections in the exposed organs. These medications are applied directly to the exposed organs to maintain a clean and sterile environment, which is crucial for the survival and well-being of the infant.

The other options listed are not appropriate for the non-operative management of omphalocele:

A. Alcohol: Alcohol is a drying agent and can cause irritation and damage to the exposed organs.
B. Aqueous mecurochrome: Mecurochrome is a dye that was used in the past for skin disinfection, but it is now considered toxic and is not recommended for use in infants.
D. Honey: Honey has antimicrobial properties, but it is not recommended for use in infants due to the risk of botulism.
E. Vaseline impregnated with penicillin: While Vaseline can help protect the exposed organs, impregnating it with penicillin is not a standard practice for omphalocele management.

Rationale: Neonatal jaundice is a common condition in newborns, characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to high levels of bilirubin in the blood. In Nigeria, as in many other parts of the world, the most common causes of neonatal jaundice are related to blood group incompatibilities between the mother and the baby. ABO incompatibility is one such cause, where the mother's blood type is O and the baby's blood type is A, B, or AB.

###Options:
A.  Kenya has almost attained the MDG target
B.  Death from HIV in pregnancy is a direct maternal death
C.  The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are haemorrhage sepsis hypertensive disease abortion and obstructed labour
D.  Maternal mortality fate and ratio are the same
E.  The target of MDGS is to reduce maternal mortality ratio by 50% by 2015

###Answer:","C. The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disease, abortion, and obstructed labour.

Rationale: The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are well-documented and include haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disease, abortion, and obstructed labour. These are the primary causes of maternal mortality in the country. Option A is incorrect because Kenya has not yet attained the MDG target for maternal mortality. Option B is incorrect because death from HIV in pregnancy is considered a direct maternal death, but it is not the only cause. Option D is incorrect because maternal mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio are not the same; the ratio is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Option E is incorrect because the target of MDGs was to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters, not 50%, by 2015.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7415019,0.85012186,0.7921055

###Answer:","C. c. Refer to the public health specialist for start of anti-TB

Rationale:
The patient has been diagnosed with TB of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), specifically affecting the ileum. The most appropriate intervention in this case would be to refer the patient to a public health specialist for the initiation of anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Anti-TB medications are the primary treatment for TB and can help control the infection and prevent further spread. Surgical intervention, such as resection of the affected parts of the GIT, is not the first-line treatment for TB of the GIT and is usually reserved for cases where medical treatment fails or complications arise.

###Answer:","D. All the above

Rationale:
Colorectal cancers are relatively less frequent in African populations due to a combination of factors. These include:

A. The young age of the population: Younger individuals have a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer, as the disease is more common in older adults.

B. Large intake of high-fiber diet: A high-fiber diet can help shorten the transit time of feces, reducing the exposure of the colon to potential carcinogens. This can lower the risk of colorectal cancer.

C. Rarity of precancerous lesions like Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis: These inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The lower prevalence of these conditions in African populations may contribute to the lower incidence of colorectal cancer.

###Answer:","C. Diagnosis is by Widal test

Rationale:
Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The correct answer to the question is option C, as the Widal test is not used for diagnosing cholera. The Widal test is a serological test used to diagnose typhoid fever, which is caused by Salmonella typhi.

A. The stool is described as rice water in appearance: This statement is true. Cholera is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, which is often described as having a ""rice water"" appearance due to its pale, milky, and watery consistency.

B. It is a known cause of acute kidney injury: This statement is true. Cholera can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can result in acute kidney injury if not treated promptly.

D. Responds to ciprofloxacin: This statement is true. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that can be used to treat cholera, as it is effective against Vibrio cholerae.

E. Antibiotics are not necessary for cure: This statement is true. While antibiotics can help reduce the duration of diarrhea and the amount of bacteria shed, they are not necessary for the cure of cholera.

###Answer:","E. Spinal cord compression

Rationale:
Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. The clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis can vary depending on the species of Schistosoma and the stage of the disease. The most common symptoms include:

A. Ground itch: This is a common symptom of Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum infections, caused by the female worms laying eggs in the skin.

B. Hepatomegaly: This refers to an enlarged liver, which can occur in Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum infections due to the accumulation of eggs in the liver.

C. Bladder cancer: Chronic infection with Schistosoma haematobium can lead to squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, as the eggs become trapped in the bladder wall and cause inflammation and cellular changes.

D. Katayama fever: This is a systemic allergic reaction that can occur in the acute phase of Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum infections, characterized by fever, cough, abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly.

###Answer:","A. types 6,11,42

Rationale:
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 200 related viruses. They are classified into two main groups: low-risk and high-risk. Low-risk HPVs can cause warts on or around the genitals, anus, mouth, or throat. High-risk HPVs can cause cancer, including cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal cancers.

D.  Tuberculous lymphadenitis explains the findings
E.  Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

###Answer:","D. Tuberculous lymphadenitis explains the findings

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms, positive HIV antibody test, and chest radiograph findings are consistent with tuberculosis (TB). TB is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals, and the butterfly pattern of bilateral peri-hilar infiltrates is characteristic of TB. The other options are not accurate in this context:

A. Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can cause pulmonary disease in HIV-positive individuals, but the radiographic findings are not typical for this condition.
B. Cotrimoxazole is actually a first-line therapy for TB in HIV-positive patients, not second-line therapy.

###Answer:","C. N-95 Filter is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation

Rationale:
A Level Six student working in a medical ward is at a higher risk of exposure to tuberculosis (TB) due to close contact with patients. Here's why option C is the correct answer:

A. BCG vaccination is not recommended for healthcare workers in high-risk settings, as it may interfere with the interpretation of the Mantoux test.
B. A positive Mantoux test indicates exposure to TB, but it does not necessarily mean excellent protection against the disease.
C. N-95 respirators are designed to filter out small particles, including TB bacteria, and are more effective than surgical masks in preventing aerosol inhalation.

###Answer:","C. Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months

Rationale: The CD4 count is a key indicator of immune function in HIV patients. A count above 200 cells/uL for more than 6 months indicates a relatively healthy immune system, which reduces the risk of opportunistic infections like PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia).

D.  The viremia would be expected to continue rising with time
E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","A. An intercurrent infection can cause this

Rationale:
The patient has been on antiretrovirals for 6 years and has maintained undetectable viral loads with his first-line regimen. However, the current HIV-RNA viral load of 245 copies/ml indicates a possible intercurrent infection or other factors affecting the viral load. It is essential to investigate the cause of the increase in viral load and address it accordingly. The other options are not appropriate in this situation. Adherence counseling and directly observed treatment (Option B) may be necessary if the patient's adherence is in question, but it is not the primary concern here. A repeat viral load in 6 months (Option C) may be considered if the viral load remains stable, but it is not the immediate next step.

E.  Boosting with ritonavir increases the metabolism of the partner drug, thereby reducing toxicity

###Answer:","C. Enfuvirtide exerts its action by binding to gp41

Rationale:
Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor that works by binding to the gp41 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, preventing the virus from entering host cells. This mechanism of action is distinct from other antiretroviral drugs, which target different stages of the viral life cycle.

Explanation of other options:
A. Zidovudine and Abacavir are both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), not thymidine analogs.
B. Dolutegravir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, making it a preferred choice for first-line therapy.
D. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are effective against HIV-1 but have limited activity against HIV-2.

D.  The seroconversion window period refers to the time from infection to the time when the laboratory is able to detect HIV antibodies
E.  The Oral HIV test demonstrates that there is some risk of transmission from oral secretions.

###Answer:","D. The seroconversion window period refers to the time from infection to the time when the laboratory is able to detect HIV antibodies.

Rationale: The seroconversion window period is the time between the initial infection with HIV and the point at which the body produces enough antibodies to be detected by a laboratory test. During this period, the individual may have been infected with HIV, but the test results may not yet show the presence of antibodies. This is why option D is the correct answer.

A. The p24 antigen can be detected during the eclipse period - This statement is false. The p24 antigen is not detectable during the eclipse period, which is the time between the initial infection and the appearance of detectable antibodies.

B. The humoral immune response is more effective than the cell-mediated immune response in controlling the infection - This statement is false. The cell-mediated immune response, particularly the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), plays a crucial role in controlling HIV infection.

C. CD4 B lymphocytes and macrophages are the primary target of infection - This statement is false. CD4 T lymphocytes are the primary target of HIV infection, not B lymphocytes.

E. The Oral HIV test demonstrates that there is some risk of transmission from oral secretions - This statement is misleading.

B.  Dexamethasone
C.  Search for systemic malignancy
D.  Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis
E.  Whole-brain radiation therapy

###Answer:","D. Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis

Rationale:
The patient's presentation of a seizure, positive serum Toxoplasma IgG, and a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe on head CT are highly suggestive of CNS toxoplasmosis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The absence of white or red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a negative Gram stain further support this diagnosis. The best course of action at this time is to initiate treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis, which typically involves a combination of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. A biopsy of the CNS lesion (Option A) is not necessary as the diagnosis is clear based on the clinical and imaging findings. Dexamethasone (Option B) is not indicated as there is no mass effect or significant edema. Searching for systemic malignancy (Option C) is not the priority given the clear diagnosis of CNS toxoplasmosis. Whole-brain radiation therapy (Option E) is not recommended due to the high risk of neurotoxicity and the availability of effective pharmacologic treatment.",D,True,0.018018017664150645,0.0,0.018018017664150645,0.7412194,0.8546645,0.7939098

###Answer:","B. Ascites

Rationale:
The urinary D-xylose test is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate the absorption capacity of the small intestine. D-xylose is a sugar that is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa and then excreted in the urine. A low level of D-xylose in the urine indicates a problem with the intestinal mucosa, such as malabsorption syndromes.

Ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, can lead to a false positive result in the urinary D-xylose test. This is because the presence of excess fluid in the abdominal cavity can dilute the concentration of D-xylose in the urine, making it appear as though the intestinal mucosa is not absorbing the sugar properly.

The other options (myocardial infarction, pneumonia, stroke, and head injury) are not directly related to the intestinal mucosa or the absorption of D-xylose, and therefore, they are less likely to cause a false positive result in the urinary D-xylose test.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.735459,0.85579646,0.79107755

Urease is an enzyme produced by H. pylori that helps the bacterium survive in the acidic environment of the stomach by breaking down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, which can neutralize the stomach acid.

Vac A (Vacuolating cytotoxin A) is a toxin produced by H. pylori that can cause damage to the gastric epithelium, leading to inflammation and ulcer formation.

Cag A (Cytotoxin-associated gene A) is a gene found in some strains of H. pylori that encodes a protein involved in the inflammatory response and is associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.

###Answer:","A. impaired antibody response/cell mediated response

Rationale:
Mycobacterium TB (M. tuberculosis) is the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis (TB).

The bacterium can survive and replicate within macrophages, which are cells that usually engulf and destroy pathogens. This allows the bacteria to persist in the host and cause disease.

The other options are not the primary reasons for the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis:

B. Hypersensitivity response to products of TB bacteria: While hypersensitivity reactions can occur in TB, they are not the primary reason for the pathogenicity of the bacterium.

C. Due to expanding granuloma: Granulomas are a result of the immune response to M. tuberculosis, not the cause of its pathogenicity.

D. Due to caseous necrosis: Caseous necrosis is a type of tissue death that can occur in TB, but it is not the primary reason for the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis.

C.  Cause formation of epithelioid cell granulomas
D.  Are killed by macrophages in primary infection
E.  Are killed by macrophages in primary infection

###Answer:","C. Cause formation of epithelioid cell granulomas

Rationale:
Mycobacteria tuberculosis is a bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). It is an aerobic, non-spore forming, non-motile bacillus. It does not induce type 2 hypersensitivity, which is typically associated with allergic reactions. Instead, it induces a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is a cell-mediated immune response.

The correct answer is C because Mycobacteria tuberculosis causes the formation of epithelioid cell granulomas. Granulomas are organized collections of immune cells that form in response to persistent pathogens or foreign substances. In the case of tuberculosis, the granulomas are composed of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and other immune cells. These granulomas help to contain the infection and prevent the spread of the bacteria.

Options A and B are incorrect because Mycobacteria tuberculosis is a bacillus, not a coccus, and it induces a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, not type 2.

C.  incubation periods can be from less than 24 hours to > 1month
D.  patients who have survived the disease confer a 10 year immunity to the disease.
E.  Does not respond to Metronidazole

###Answer:","A. Spasm begins in the pripheris and spread truncal then into facial muscles

Rationale: Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani. The bacteria produce a toxin that affects the nervous system, leading to muscle stiffness and spasms. The initial spasms often start in the jaw (pripheris) and then spread to the trunk and facial muscles. This is a characteristic feature of tetanus and helps in its diagnosis.

B. Less than 1% of tetanus can occur without a wound identified

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. Tetanus is primarily associated with wounds, especially those contaminated with soil, dust, or feces, where the bacteria can thrive. While it's possible for tetanus to occur without a wound, it's extremely rare, and the majority of cases are linked to an injury.

C. Incubation periods can be from less than 24 hours to > 1 month

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. The incubation period for tetanus is typically between 3 and 21 days, with an average of 8 days. It is not common for the incubation period to be longer than 1 month.

D. Patients who have survived the disease confer a 10-year immunity to the disease.

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. Tetanus is not a disease that confers long-lasting immunity. Even if a person has survived tetanus, they can still be susceptible to future infections. Vaccination is the best way to prevent tetanus.

E. Does not respond to Metronidazole

Rationale: This statement is incorrect. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that can be used to treat tetanus infections. It is effective against Clostridium tetani, the bacteria responsible for tetanus.

Rationale:
Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. The four main species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans are P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. Each species has its own unique characteristics, including the periodicity of fever.

P. ovale is known for causing tertian malaria, which means the fever occurs every third day (or every 48 hours). This is due to the life cycle of the parasite within the red blood cells. P. vivax and P. ovale can also cause quartan malaria, with fever occurring every fourth day (or every 72 hours). P. falciparum, on the other hand, is associated with more severe and unpredictable fever patterns.

Therefore, P. ovale is the organism least likely to show the characteristic periodicity of fever in malaria, as it can cause both tertian and quartan malaria, which have more predictable fever patterns compared to the fever patterns caused by P. falciparum.",D,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7334342,0.8576536,0.7906949

D.  Myocarditis
E.  hematochezia

###Answer:","B. Eosinophilia

Rationale:
Acute schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama fever, is a systemic inflammatory response to the eggs of Schistosoma parasites. The main characteristic of acute schistosomiasis is eosinophilia, which is an increased number of eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that play a role in the immune response against parasitic infections.

The other options are not typical characteristics of acute schistosomiasis:

A. Paraparesis: This refers to partial paralysis of the lower limbs, which is not a common symptom of acute schistosomiasis.

C. Convulsions: Seizures are not a typical symptom of acute schistosomiasis.

D. Myocarditis: This is an inflammation of the heart muscle, which is not a common symptom of acute schistosomiasis.

D.  Trophozoites have four flagella
E.  Is a fluke

###Answer:","A. Giardia Lamblia is usually acquired by ingestion of food and water contaminated by the cysts.

Rationale: Giardia Lamblia is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, a diarrheal illness. It is typically acquired through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, specifically the cysts of the parasite. The cysts are resistant to environmental conditions and can survive in water for long periods. Once ingested, the cysts transform into trophozoites in the small intestine, where they multiply and cause symptoms.

B. Mepacrine is not an effective treatment for Giardia Lamblia. The most common medications used to treat giardiasis are metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide.

C. Giardia cysts can survive in water boiled for at least one minute, but boiling for ten minutes is not necessary. The cysts are resistant to chlorine and can survive in water that has been treated with chlorine.

D. Giardia trophozoites do not have flagella. They have a unique structure called a ""ventral disc,"" which allows them to attach to the intestinal wall.

There are two forms of the disease: the Gambian form (caused by T. b. gambiense) and the Rhodesian form (caused by T. b. rhodesiense). The Gambian form is more chronic and progresses slowly, while the Rhodesian form is more acute and progresses rapidly. Pentamidine is an effective treatment for the Rhodesian form, but not for the Gambian form. The Gambian form is typically treated with suramin or melarsoprol. Erythema chronicum migrans is associated with Lyme disease, not African trypanosomiasis. The incubation period for African trypanosomiasis is typically 1-3 months, not 4-6 months. The Gambian form does not have a more prominent chancre than the Rhodesian form.",E,True,0.1609195378517638,0.05217391117429119,0.1609195378517638,0.77726495,0.85459465,0.8140976

C.  intussusception
D.  Post-operative adhesions
E.  Gall bladder stone

###Answer:","B. Stangulated inguinal hernia

Rationale:
In Nigeria, the commonest cause of intestinal obstruction is stangulated inguinal hernia. This is due to the high prevalence of this condition in the region, which is often associated with poor surgical techniques and lack of post-operative care. Stangulated inguinal hernias occur when a portion of the intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall, often due to a previous surgery or injury. The stangulation refers to the use of a mesh or suture to reinforce the weakened area, which can lead to obstruction if not properly managed.",B,True,0.24175823777321584,0.12068965160077297,0.21978021579519388,0.85094,0.8904531,0.87024826

C.  There is very low or absent malarial antibody titers
D.  There is reduced serum IgM
E.  There is unfavorable response to prolonged anti-malarial drug therapy

###Answer:","C. There is very low or absent malarial antibody titers


Rationale:
Tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS), also known as hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), is a condition that occurs in some individuals who live in or have traveled to malaria-endemic areas. It is characterized by an exaggerated immune response to repeated exposure to malaria parasites, particularly Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. The hallmark of TSS is a markedly enlarged spleen and a high level of IgM antibodies against malaria antigens. However, the malarial antibody titers in TSS are often very low or absent, which is a distinguishing feature from other malaria-related conditions. This is because the immune system in TSS patients is not effectively producing antibodies against the malaria parasites.

Rationale:
Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) in children can be caused by various factors, including congenital heart defects, infections, and other medical conditions. In Nigeria, where access to healthcare and resources may be limited, infectious causes of CCF are more prevalent. Septicemia, or blood poisoning by bacteria, is a common cause of CCF in children due to the systemic inflammatory response it triggers, which can lead to heart failure.

While pneumonia (A) can cause respiratory distress and contribute to heart failure, it is not as directly linked to CCF as septicemia. Tetralogy of Fallot (B) and Transposition of Great Arteries (D) are congenital heart defects that can lead to CCF, but they are not as common in Nigerian children as septicemia.

B.  Choreoathetoid is the commonest type in Africa
C.  Predominant cause in Nigeria is congenital toxoplasmosis
D.  Cortical atrophy is the basic pathologic manifestation
E.  Mental retardation is a constant feature

###Answer:","A. Perinatal causes are commoner than prenatal causes in Africa

Rationale: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood. The causes of CP can be prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal. In Africa, perinatal causes, such as birth asphyxia, prematurity, and infections, are more common than prenatal causes. This is due to various factors, including limited access to prenatal care, high rates of maternal infections, and complications during childbirth.

B. Choreoathetoid is the commonest type in Africa

Rationale: Choreoathetoid cerebral palsy is not the most common type in Africa. The most common type of CP in Africa is spastic cerebral palsy, which accounts for about 70-80% of cases. Choreoathetoid CP is characterized by involuntary movements and is less common than spastic CP.

C. Predominant cause in Nigeria is congenital toxoplasmosis

Rationale: Congenital toxoplasmosis is not the predominant cause of cerebral palsy in Nigeria. As mentioned earlier, perinatal causes, such as birth asphyxia, prematurity, and infections, are more common in Africa. Congenital toxoplasmosis is a rare cause of CP and is not the leading cause in Nigeria.

D. Cortical atrophy is the basic pathologic manifestation

Rationale: Cortical atrophy is not the basic pathologic manifestation of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is primarily caused by damage to the developing brain, which can result from various factors such as infections, lack of oxygen, or trauma. The damage leads to abnormalities in muscle tone, movement, and posture. Cortical atrophy may occur in some cases of CP, but it is not the primary pathologic manifestation.

B.  Convulsion is a constant feature
C.  Altered sensorium is typical
D.  Drug of choice is intravenous artesunate
E.  Cortical blindness is a known sequela

###Answer:","D. Drug of choice is intravenous artesunate

Rationale: In cerebral malaria, the drug of choice is intravenous artesunate. This is because it has been shown to be more effective and safer than quinine, which was previously the standard treatment. Artesunate is a fast-acting antimalarial drug that can rapidly reduce the parasite load in the blood, thereby decreasing the risk of severe complications and death.

A. The age incidence is 6-10 years - This statement is incorrect. Cerebral malaria can affect individuals of all ages, but it is more common in children under the age of 5.

B. Convulsion is a constant feature - This statement is incorrect. While convulsions can occur in cerebral malaria, they are not a constant feature. The clinical presentation of cerebral malaria can vary widely, and not all patients will experience convulsions.

C. Altered sensorium is typical - This statement is incorrect. Altered sensorium, or changes in mental status, can occur in cerebral malaria, but it is not typical in all cases. Some patients may present with more severe neurological symptoms, such as seizures or coma.

###Answer:","C. Sun-setting eye appearance

Rationale:
The child's symptoms suggest tetanus, a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani. The inability to open the mouth (trismus) and jerky movements (spasms) are classic signs of tetanus. Sun-setting eye appearance, also known as risus sardonicus, is a characteristic facial expression seen in severe cases of tetanus, where the muscles of the face contract and the eyebrows are raised.

###Answer:","D. Viral Meningitis

Rationale:
Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can lead to several complications, especially in young children. Among the options provided, viral meningitis is a common complication of measles. It occurs when the measles virus infects the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms of viral meningitis include fever, headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term neurological damage.

The other options are less likely to be complications of measles:

A. Tuberculosis: While measles can weaken the immune system, making a person more susceptible to other infections like tuberculosis, it is not a direct complication of measles.

B. Paraesthesia: This refers to abnormal sensations like tingling or prickling, which can be caused by various conditions, but it is not a common complication of measles.

C. Heart failure: Measles can cause myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), but it is not a common complication and heart failure is not typically associated with measles.

A.  Nephroblastoma
B.  Cystitis
C.  Schistosomiasis
D.  Renal vein thrombosis

###Answer:","C. Schistosomiasis

Rationale:
Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (trematode worms) of the genus Schistosoma. It is endemic in many parts of Africa, including rural areas. The disease is transmitted through contact with contaminated water, where the larvae of the parasite can penetrate the skin.

In the context of the survey, the prevalence of painless haematuria (blood in urine without pain) in children from a rural primary school suggests a possible link to a waterborne disease. Among the given options, schistosomiasis is the most likely cause of painless haematuria in this setting.

Nephroblastoma (A) is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children, but it is not associated with waterborne transmission. Cystitis (B) is an inflammation of the bladder, often caused by a bacterial infection, and it usually presents with painful urination, not painless haematuria. Renal vein thrombosis (D) is a blood clot in the renal vein, which can cause haematuria, but it is not a common condition in children and is not associated with waterborne transmission.

###Question: WRITE A SHORT NOTE ON THE WAYS OF PREVENTING ACUTE DIARRHEA DISEASE IN MOTHERS AND CHILDREN IN LAGOS STATE NIGERIA 
###Options:

###Answer:","Answer: Implementing hygiene education, promoting breastfeeding, ensuring safe water and sanitation, and vaccination.

Rationale:

Acute diarrhea is a common illness in Lagos State, Nigeria, affecting both mothers and children. The following measures can help prevent the occurrence and spread of acute diarrhea:

1. Hygiene education: Educating the community about proper handwashing techniques, safe food handling, and general cleanliness can significantly reduce the risk of diarrhea. This includes teaching people to wash their hands with soap and water before eating, after using the toilet, and after handling raw food.

2. Promoting breastfeeding: Breastfeeding provides infants with essential nutrients and antibodies that help protect them from infections, including diarrhea. Mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies exclusively for the first six months of life and continue breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods for up to two years or beyond.

3. Ensuring safe water and sanitation: Access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities is crucial in preventing diarrhea. Communities should be provided with safe drinking water sources, and sanitation facilities should be constructed and maintained to prevent the contamination of water sources.

4. Vaccination: Vaccinating children against rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhea, can help prevent the disease. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended for infants in Lagos State, and efforts should be made to ensure that all children receive the vaccine on schedule.

By implementing these preventive measures, the incidence of acute diarrhea in mothers and children in Lagos State can be significantly reduced, leading to better health outcomes for the community.",A,True,0.20066889133365412,0.023255808977826916,0.18729096491224945,0.82915443,0.81564486,0.82234424

###Options:
A.  Pulmonary oedema
B.  Acute renal insufficiency
C.  Haemoglobinuria
D.  Hyperbilirubinaemia

###Answer:","C. Haemoglobinuria

Rationale:
The child's symptoms suggest a severe case of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The presence of asexual forms of the parasite on the blood film indicates active infection. Among the given options, haemoglobinuria is the most likely to be present in this child. Haemoglobinuria, also known as ""blackwater fever,"" is a rare but severe complication of malaria characterized by the presence of hemoglobin in the urine. This occurs due to the lysis of red blood cells by the parasite, leading to the release of hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which is then filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. The other options, such as pulmonary edema, acute renal insufficiency, and hyperbilirubinaemia, can also occur in severe malaria cases, but haemoglobinuria is more directly associated with the presence of asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum on the blood film.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7377621,0.8465847,0.78843606

Rationale:
Carcinoma of the ovary is predominantly of epithelial origin, accounting for about 90% of all ovarian cancers. The other types include germ cell tumors and stromal tumors, which are less common. The incidence of ovarian cancer is higher in developed countries, not developing ones, making option A incorrect. The peak age for ovarian cancer is around 60 years old, not 80-90 years old, which makes option C incorrect. While surgery is a key component of treatment, radiotherapy is not typically used in the management of ovarian cancer, making option D incorrect.

###Options:
A.  Sickle cell anaemia.
B.  Iron deficiency
C.  Glucose-6- Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency.

###Answer:","B. Iron deficiency

Rationale:
The haematocrit level is a measure of the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. A haematocrit level of 23% to 26% is below the normal range for children (which is typically around 33% to 52% for boys and 30% to 48% for girls). This condition, known as anemia, can be caused by various factors, including nutritional deficiencies. Among the options provided, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in children, especially in developing countries where dietary intake of iron may be insufficient. Sickle cell anemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are genetic conditions that can also cause anemia, but they are less common than iron deficiency.

###Options:
A.  Pentavalent I, II and III
B.  Anti-Tetanus serum
C.  Measles
D.  Tetanus toxoid

###Answer:","D. Tetanus toxoid


Rationale:
Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns. It is typically caused by contamination of the umbilical stump, especially when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument. The tetanus toxoid vaccine is specifically designed to prevent tetanus, including neonatal tetanus. It works by inducing active immunity in the mother during pregnancy, which is then passed on to the fetus, providing protection after birth.


Option A, Pentavalent vaccine, is a combination vaccine that protects against five diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). While it does include the tetanus component, it is not specifically targeted at neonatal tetanus prevention.


Option B, Anti-Tetanus serum, is an antitoxin that can be used to treat tetanus infection, but it is not a preventive measure for neonatal tetanus.

Rationale:
Severe malaria in children can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations due to the blockage of the microvasculature by infected red blood cells and the release of inflammatory mediators. Hypoglycaemia (A) can occur due to the increased metabolic demand and impaired glucose production. Pulmonary oedema (B) is a result of the sequestration of infected red blood cells in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and fluid accumulation.
