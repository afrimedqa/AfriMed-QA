His history is significant for a trip to Nepal. Vital signs are temperature 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate 102 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and blood pressure 108/74 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals icterus and splenomegaly. Laboratory results are hemoglobin 11 g/dL and the peripheral smear shows erythrocytes with brick-red granules. A presumptive diagnosis is made and the patient is hospitalized and started on appropriate therapy. On the 3rd hospital day, the develops a sudden increase in heart rate. An electrocardiogram is obtained (see below). What was the most likely drug administered?

","A patient with recent travel history, cyclical fever, and brick red granules (Schüffner stippling) in erythrocytes suggests the diagnosis of malaria. The patient was most likely treated with chloroquine, a quinoline derivative that is a first-line agent for Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale infections. Chloroquine can cause marked QT prolongation and can cause severe ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes.

Patients on antimalarials should be monitored with an ECG regularly. The common side effect of chloroquine is gastrointestinal upset (GI), headache, blurred vision, and insomnia.

Which of the following is the most important cause for type II respiratory failure in myasthenia gravis?,"The most important cause for type II respiratory failure in myasthenia gravis is early fatigue of inspiratory muscles.Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly in the voluntary muscles. In the context of respiratory function, weakness and fatigue of the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, can lead to inadequate ventilation. This inadequate ventilation results in impaired clearance of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to type II respiratory failure (hypercapnic respiratory failure).While other factors such as increased resistance to ventilation or depression of the dorsal respiratory group of neurons may contribute to respiratory dysfunction in certain conditions, early fatigue of inspiratory muscles is the primary mechanism responsible for type II respiratory failure in myasthenia gravis.",D,Increased resistance to ventilation,Pulmonary vasoconstriction,Increased vagal stimulation of pontine centres,Early fatigue of inspiratory muscles,Depression of dorsal respiratory group of neurons,C,False

She has a history of regular menstruation transpiring every 28 days. Pregnancy is validated via β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), with ultrasound affirming the anticipated gestational age. In consideration of this patient's circumstances, what method of pregnancy termination would be both safe and efficacious at this juncture?","Surgical abortion stands as one of the safest medical procedures, boasting a minimal serious complication rate of less than 1% during the first trimester, with a mortality rate merely a fraction of that associated with term delivery. Suction dilation and curettage represent the preferred method during the initial trimester. Internationally, the combination of the oral agent RU-486 followed by prostaglandin injection has demonstrated remarkable efficacy and safety, particularly within European clinical trials, proving effective up to approximately 9 weeks of gestation. Additionally, 15-methyl α-prostaglandin serves as a viable intramuscular abortifacient, alongside options such as prostaglandin E2 suppositories or intraamniotic prostaglandin F2α for second-trimester induction of preterm labor. In light of safety concerns, intraamniotic injection of hypertonic saline is no longer deemed suitable due to its heightened risk of serious complications, including mortality, hyperosmolar crisis, cardiac failure, peritonitis, hemorrhage, and coagulation abnormalities.
