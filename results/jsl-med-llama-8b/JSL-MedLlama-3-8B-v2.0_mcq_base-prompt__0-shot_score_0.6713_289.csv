###Answer:","D.  Simple (nontoxic) goiter

Rationale: Simple (nontoxic) goiter is characterized by an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, often resulting in a visibly enlarged neck. This condition is endemic in certain regions of Africa due to dietary iodine deficiency. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition that leads to hypothyroidism, not goiter. Graves' disease is another autoimmune condition that leads to hyperthyroidism, also not goiter. Toxic multinodular goiter is a condition where multiple nodules in the thyroid gland produce excess thyroid hormone, leading to hyperthyroidism.

###Question: Which of the following conditions, endemic in Africa, is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the lining of the stomach or duodenum and is often caused by infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori?
###Options:
A.  Gastritis
B.  Peptic ulcer disease
C.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
D.  Esophageal varices
E.  Gastroenteritis

###Answer:","B.  Peptic ulcer disease

Rationale: Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by the development of open sores, or ulcers, in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). It is a common condition in Africa and is often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacterium. The infection leads to inflammation of the stomach or duodenal lining, which can cause the mucosa to break down and form an ulcer. Other factors such as stress, certain medications, and smoking can also contribute to the development of peptic ulcers. Gastritis, on the other hand, refers to inflammation of the stomach lining without the formation of ulcers. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn. Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus that can occur in people with liver disease. Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection, but it does not specifically involve ulceration. Therefore, peptic ulcer disease is the correct answer as it is the condition that involves inflammation and ulceration of the stomach or duodenum, often caused by H. pylori infection.",B,True,0.450261775292344,0.23943661494147994,0.4083769585384172,0.8891117,0.9093989,0.8991409

###Question: A 25-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 2-week history of fever, headache, and joint pain. She also complains of a rash on her legs that started a few days ago. She has a history of traveling to a rural area in West Africa last month. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Dengue fever
B.  Malaria
C.  Lyme disease
D.  Yellow fever
E.  Zika virus

###Answer:","B.  Malaria

Rationale: Given the patient's recent travel history to a rural area in West Africa, the most likely diagnosis is malaria. Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, joint pain, and rash, which align with the patient's presentation. Dengue fever, another mosquito-borne illness, can also cause similar symptoms but is less likely given the patient's travel history. Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks and is not common in West Africa.

Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common cause of acute liver failure in Africa. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection is high in many African countries, and acute exacerbations of chronic HBV can lead to acute liver failure. In contrast, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is more commonly associated with chronic liver disease rather than acute liver failure. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that can cause liver damage, but it is not a common cause of acute liver failure in Africa.

Rationale: Intestinal obstruction is indeed the most common cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria. Acute abdomen refers to a sudden onset of abdominal pain that requires immediate medical attention. Intestinal obstruction occurs when there is a blockage in the intestine, which can be caused by various factors such as adhesions, hernias, tumors, or foreign bodies. This condition can lead to severe symptoms such as abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation, and requires prompt surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction and prevent complications.

###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Septic arthritis
D.  Gout
E.  Pseudogout

###Answer:","C.  Septic arthritis

Rationale: The clinical presentation of a painful, swollen, and warm knee, along with an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance in the synovial fluid analysis, is highly suggestive of septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is an acute infection of the joint space, often caused by bacteria entering the joint through a wound or hematogenous spread. The presence of neutrophils in the synovial fluid indicates an acute inflammatory response, which is characteristic of septic arthritis. In contrast, osteoarthritis typically presents with a chronic, progressive pain and swelling, and synovial fluid analysis would show a lower white blood cell count with a predominance of monocytes. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune condition that affects multiple joints and would not typically present with a predominance of neutrophils in the synovial fluid.

###Answer:","B.  Cataracts

Rationale: Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in African adults. This is due to the high prevalence of cataracts in the region, which can be attributed to a combination of factors including age, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and nutritional deficiencies. While glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and trachoma are also significant causes of blindness, cataracts remain the most common cause in this population.

###Answer:","C.  Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs)
Rationale: Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) are the most appropriate initial treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma due to their rapid onset of action and ability to relieve bronchospasm. Inhaled corticosteroids are used for long-term management of asthma, not for acute exacerbations. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, not for acute relief. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can be used for maintenance therapy, but they are not the first-line treatment for acute exacerbations.

D.  Limb amputation
E.  Conservative management with regular wound cleaning

###Answer:","C. Surgical debridement and irrigation

Rationale: Surgical debridement and irrigation is the most appropriate initial management for a large, infected wound on the leg in a rural African community. This approach is necessary to remove devitalized tissue, foreign bodies, and any necrotic material that can harbor bacteria and impede healing. Debridement helps to reduce the bacterial load and prevent further infection, while irrigation helps to clean the wound and remove any debris. This intervention is crucial in resource-limited settings where access to advanced wound care products and antibiotics may be limited. Topical antibiotics and dressings (Option A) may not be sufficient to manage a large, deep wound with significant contamination. Oral antibiotics (Option B) may be used in conjunction with debridement, but they are not the primary intervention. Limb amputation (Option D) is not indicated as a first-line management for a large, infected wound without evidence of gangrene or severe tissue loss.

Physical examination reveals joint laxity and a positive Lachman test. Imaging reveals a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option?
###Options:
A.  Conservative management with physical therapy
B.  Open ACL repair
C.  Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction
D.  Knee brace immobilization
E.  Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint

###Answer:","C. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction

Rationale: The most appropriate treatment option for a torn ACL in a patient with chronic knee pain, swelling, and instability is arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. This surgical procedure involves replacing the torn ACL with a graft, typically taken from the patient's own patellar tendon or hamstring tendon. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is preferred because it allows for visualization of the knee joint and precise placement of the graft, leading to better outcomes and faster recovery compared to open repair. Conservative management with physical therapy may be considered in patients with mild ACL tears or as part of a post-operative rehabilitation program, but it is not sufficient as the primary treatment for a torn ACL. Open ACL repair is less common due to the development of arthroscopic techniques and has a longer recovery time. Knee brace immobilization and corticosteroid injections may provide temporary relief but do not address the underlying structural damage to the ACL.",C,True,0.16949152272191903,0.03614457619393248,0.10169491255242753,0.83517975,0.8970349,0.86500293

###Answer:","A.  True
Rationale: Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 85% of the global burden of schistosomiasis occurs in Africa. The disease is prevalent in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. The high prevalence in Africa is due to various factors, including the presence of suitable snail intermediate hosts, lack of awareness and education, and limited access to healthcare. Therefore, the statement that >80% of the people affected by schistosomiasis live in Africa is true.",A,True,0.285714282540756,0.12499999742506382,0.285714282540756,0.85108167,0.92434454,0.8862015

Rationale: Ultrasound is the most widely available and commonly used imaging modality for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver cirrhosis and related complications in Africa. It is a non-invasive, portable, and cost-effective method that can be performed at the bedside or in a clinic setting. Ultrasound can assess liver texture, size, and blood flow, which are important parameters in the evaluation of liver cirrhosis. Additionally, it can detect complications such as portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.

###Answer:","B. Viral hepatitis B
Rationale: Viral hepatitis B is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Africa. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly endemic in many parts of Africa, with high prevalence rates leading to a significant burden of chronic liver disease. HBV is transmitted through blood and other body fluids, and it can lead to chronic infection, which increases the risk of developing cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The high incidence of HBV in Africa is attributed to factors such as poor sanitation, lack of access to healthcare, and limited vaccination coverage. In contrast, alcoholic liver disease is more common in regions with high alcohol consumption, NAFLD is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, and diabetes is a risk factor for liver disease but is not the primary cause in Africa.

Rationale: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause anticholinergic side effects, including cognitive impairment and increased risk of falls. These symptoms are more common in older adults, especially those with pre-existing cognitive impairment. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and has a low risk of causing falls or cognitive impairment. Metformin is an oral antidiabetic medication that does not typically cause falls or cognitive impairment. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that can increase the risk of bleeding but is not commonly associated with falls or cognitive impairment.

B.  Intravenous lorazepam
C.  Intramuscular diazepam
D.  Oral carbamazepine
E.  Intravenous fosphenytoin

###Answer:","A. Intramuscular midazolam

Rationale: In a resource-limited emergency department in Africa, the most appropriate initial treatment for a patient presenting with status epilepticus is intramuscular midazolam. This is because midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that can be administered via the intramuscular route, which is useful in settings where intravenous access is difficult to establish. Additionally, midazolam is effective in controlling seizures and has a rapid onset of action, making it an ideal choice for initial management of status epilepticus. Intravenous lorazepam and intravenous fosphenytoin are also effective treatments for status epilepticus, but they require intravenous access, which may not be readily available in all emergency departments in Africa. Intramuscular diazepam is another option, but it is not as rapidly acting as midazolam and may not be as effective in controlling seizures in the initial phase of status epilepticus. Oral carbamazepine is not appropriate for initial treatment as it requires absorption and may not provide rapid enough relief of seizures.

###Answer:","A.  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)

The patient's presentation of fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is most consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). In AIHA, the immune system produces antibodies that attack and destroy red blood cells, leading to anemia. The positive DAT indicates the presence of these antibodies on the surface of the patient's red blood cells. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, renal dysfunction, and neurological symptoms, which are not described in this case. Iron deficiency anemia would not cause thrombocytopenia or a positive DAT.

###Options:
A.  Transient immunodeficiency
B.  Congenital immunodeficiency
C.  Primary immunodeficiency
D.  Secondary immunodeficiency
E.  Autoimmune immunodeficiency

###Answer:","D.  Secondary immunodeficiency

Rationale: HIV/AIDS is a secondary immunodeficiency disorder, which means that it is acquired rather than being present from birth. In Africa, HIV/AIDS is a major cause of secondary immunodeficiency, leading to a weakened immune system and increased susceptibility to infections and certain types of cancer. The other options, such as transient, congenital, primary, and autoimmune immunodeficiencies, are not typically associated with HIV/AIDS in Africa. Transient immunodeficiency refers to temporary conditions that affect the immune system, congenital immunodeficiency is present from birth, primary immunodeficiency is a genetic disorder of the immune system, and autoimmune immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues.",D,True,0.33027522499789586,0.12949639871849297,0.31192660114468485,0.8522439,0.8770459,0.8644671

###Answer:","D. Major depressive disorder (MDD)

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with those of major depressive disorder (MDD), which is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, feelings of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts of death. These symptoms are not typically associated with the other conditions listed, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

###Answer:","E. Tuberculosis

Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of chronic cough in Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB remains a major public health problem in Africa, with high prevalence rates and significant morbidity and mortality. Chronic cough is a common symptom of TB, and it is often associated with other symptoms such as weight loss, fever, and night sweats.

###Question: A 30-year-old African patient presents with hives, angioedema, and wheezing shortly after consuming seafood. Which of the following immunoglobulins is most likely involved in this allergic reaction?
###Options:
A.  IgA
B.  IgD
C.  IgE
D.  IgG
E.  IgM

###Answer:","C.  IgE
Rationale: The symptoms described, including hives, angioedema, and wheezing, are characteristic of an allergic reaction. The most likely immunoglobulin involved in this type of reaction is IgE. IgE is responsible for triggering allergic responses by binding to mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other mediators that lead to the symptoms observed. This is consistent with a type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is the most common type of allergic reaction. The other immunoglobulins listed, such as IgA, IgD, IgG, and IgM, are not typically involved in immediate allergic reactions. IgA is primarily involved in mucosal immunity, IgD plays a role in antigen recognition, IgG is involved in antibody-mediated immunity, and IgM is the first immunoglobulin to be produced in response to an antigen.

Rationale:  In societies where communal living is common, the most likely diagnosis for a patient presenting with symptoms of recurrent, intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed in response to these obsessions is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This is because OCD is characterized by these specific symptoms, regardless of the cultural context.

Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant cause of chronic liver disease in African adults. The prevalence of HBV infection is high in many African countries, and it can lead to chronic liver inflammation, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Alcoholic liver disease is also a common cause, but it is more prevalent in regions with high alcohol consumption. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in prevalence globally, but it is not as common in Africa as HBV infection.

DMPA is preferred in Kenya due to its convenience, as it only requires an injection every three months, and its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy. It is also a popular choice among women who have completed childbearing or are not ready to have children yet. The other options, such as pills, mesigyno, Jadelle, and IUCD, are also used in Kenya but are not as widely used as DMPA. Pills are often used by women who prefer a daily method of contraception, while mesigyno and Jadelle are long-acting reversible contraceptives that are less common. IUCD is also used, particularly among women who want a non-hormonal method of contraception. However, DMPA remains the most popular choice due to its ease of use and high effectiveness.",D,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75334024,0.84638035,0.7971547

A.  Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) should not be given concomitantly with antiretrovirals
B.  The recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester is a three-day course of artemether lumefantrine (AL)
C.  Dihydroartemisinin Piperaquine may be used as IPTp for those who are allergic to sulfur
D.  Sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp should be given concomitantly with IFAS for prevention of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy.
E.  The dose of IV quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy, should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency

###Answer:","D. Sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp should be given concomitantly with IFAS for prevention of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy.  #Rationale: The Kenyan protocol recommends the use of Sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine (SP) for Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy (IPTp) to be given concomitantly with Iron Folic Acid Supplements (IFAS) for the prevention of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy. This is because SP has been shown to be effective in preventing malaria and anaemia in pregnant women, and the concomitant administration of IFAS helps to address the nutritional needs of the mother and fetus. The other options are incorrect based on the current Kenyan guidelines for malaria in pregnancy. For example, SP can be given with antiretrovirals, the recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester is not AL, Dihydroartemisinin Piperaquine is not used as IPTp for those allergic to sulfur, and the dose of IV quinine for severe malaria in pregnancy is not adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.",D,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73056006,0.84378576,0.7831014

Rationale: Ceftriaxone is recommended as a first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis pending culture results because it has good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and covers a wide range of pathogens that can cause meningitis, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. It is also effective against many other bacterial infections that may be present in patients with meningitis. Cefuroxime, Cefepime, and Amoxicillin are not as effective as Ceftriaxone in treating bacterial meningitis, and their use may be limited to specific cases or as part of combination therapy.

###Answer:","C.  Thick slides have higher sensitivity compared to thin slides on microscopy

Rationale: Thick blood films have a higher sensitivity for detecting malaria parasites compared to thin blood films because they contain a larger volume of blood, increasing the chances of detecting the presence of parasites. This is particularly useful in areas where malaria is endemic and the parasite load is high. However, thick films are more difficult to interpret and may require expert microscopy.

Rationale: HIV primarily targets CD4+ T cells, which are a subset of T lymphocytes. These cells play a crucial role in the immune system by helping to activate other immune cells to fight infections. HIV infects these cells by binding to the CD4 receptor on their surface, which allows the virus to enter and replicate within the cell.

###Answer:","B.  Window Period

Rationale: The 'window period' refers to the time interval between HIV infection and the appearance of antibodies against the virus in the serum. During this period, which can last from 2 to 8 weeks, the virus replicates and infects CD4+ T cells, but the immune system has not yet produced enough antibodies to be detected by standard serological tests.

Rationale: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient presents with symptoms of fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain, which are common in CAP. The fact that the patient is a young, previously healthy individual increases the likelihood of CAP, as it is more commonly seen in otherwise healthy individuals. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are more commonly associated with smoking and are less likely in a young, non-smoking individual.

###Options:
A.  BCG
B.  Isoniazid
C.  Pyrazinamide
D.  Moxifloxacin

###Answer:","B.  Isoniazid
Rationale: Isoniazid is the preferred treatment for latent TB infection in patients living with HIV. It is part of the standard regimen for preventing active TB in HIV-infected individuals, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The other options, such as BCG, Pyrazinamide, Moxifloxacin, and Ethambutol, are not typically used for this purpose. BCG is a vaccine used to prevent severe forms of TB in children, but it is not used to treat latent TB infection in adults. Pyrazinamide is an antibiotic used in the treatment of active TB, not latent TB. Moxifloxacin and Ethambutol are also antibiotics used in the treatment of active TB, but they are not the first-line drugs for latent TB infection in HIV patients. Therefore, Isoniazid is the correct choice for treating latent TB infection in this population.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73040164,0.8469943,0.784389

###Answer:","A.  Cervical lymph nodes

The commonest site for extrapulmonary tuberculosis is the cervical lymph nodes. This is because the lymphatic drainage of the head and neck region primarily drains into the cervical lymph nodes, making them a common site for the spread of tuberculosis. The spread of tuberculosis to the cervical lymph nodes can occur through the hematogenous route or by direct extension from an infected lung.

E.  Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

###Answer:","C.  Dapsone has no role in the management
Rationale: The patient's presentation of fever, dyspnea, and cough, along with bilateral peri-hilar interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph, is suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). PJP is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients. The butterfly pattern of infiltrates is characteristic of PJP. Dapsone is not used in the management of PJP. The first-line therapy for PJP is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and if the patient does not respond, alternative therapies such as cotrimoxazole, clindamycin, or pentamidine can be considered. Corticosteroids may be used in severe cases of PJP to reduce inflammation and improve oxygenation. Cryptococcosis is another opportunistic infection in HIV patients but typically presents with different radiographic findings. Tuberculous lymphadenitis would not explain the bilateral interstitial infiltrates seen in this patient.

###Question: When considering preventive therapy in HIV patients which of these statements is TRUE?
###Options:
A.  Universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is mandatory for all patients unless contraindicated
B.  Dapsone can be used when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated for prophylaxis and should be continued indefinitely
C.  Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months
D.  A course of Isoniazid preventive therapy should only be offered to patients who have a history of TB contact
E.  Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy should be given to all patients with a CD4 < 100cells/uL when they are initiating antiretroviral treatment

###Answer:","A. Universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is mandatory for all patients unless contraindicated
Rationale: The correct answer is A. Universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is mandatory for all patients unless contraindicated. This is because Cotrimoxazole is effective in preventing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and other opportunistic infections in HIV patients. While other options may be considered in specific situations, universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is a standard of care for all HIV patients who do not have contraindications to the medication. Dapsone can be used as an alternative to Cotrimoxazole in certain cases, but it is not the default choice. Primary prophylaxis for PCP can be discontinued when the CD4 count is maintained above 200 cells/uL for more than 6 months, but this is not a blanket recommendation for all patients. Isoniazid preventive therapy is offered to patients at risk of TB exposure, not just those with a history of TB contact. Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy is not routinely recommended for all patients with a CD4 count below 100 cells/uL starting antiretroviral therapy.",A,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7160163,0.84110713,0.77353716

###Question: A patient who has been on antiretrovirals for 6 years and who has maintained undetectable viral loads with his first-line regimen presents with an HIV-RNA viral load of 245 copies/ml. Which of the following is TRUE?
###Options:
A.  An intercurrent infection can cause this
B.  He should have adherence counseling and directly observed treatment and repeat the viral load in a year
C.  A repeat viral load should be done in 6 months and if similar levels are obtained, he should be switched to a second-line regimen
D.  The viremia would be expected to continue rising with time
E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","C.  A repeat viral load should be done in 6 months and if similar levels are obtained, he should be switched to a second-line regimen.  Rationale: A viral load of 245 copies/ml is considered a blip, which is a temporary increase in viral load above the undetectable threshold. In this case, the patient has been on a first-line regimen for 6 years and has maintained undetectable viral loads. The next step is to repeat the viral load in 6 months to confirm if this is a persistent increase or just a temporary blip. If the viral load remains elevated, it may indicate resistance to the current regimen, and switching to a second-line regimen would be appropriate. Adherence counseling and directly observed treatment are important, but they are not the primary concern at this stage. Intercurrent infections can cause temporary increases in viral load, but this would not be the primary concern given the patient's history of undetectable viral loads. Laboratory variations and errors are always a consideration, but the patient's history and the magnitude of the viral load increase suggest that this is not the primary cause. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to repeat the viral load in 6 months and consider a switch to a second-line regimen if necessary.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.753657,0.85425234,0.8008079

###Answer:","A.  The lifetime risk for developing active TB in HIV-infected individuals is twice that of HIV-uninfected individuals.  Rationale: HIV-infected individuals have a higher lifetime risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB) compared to HIV-uninfected individuals. This is because HIV weakens the immune system, making it easier for TB bacteria to grow and cause disease. The risk of developing active TB is particularly high in people with advanced HIV disease, such as those with a CD4 count below 50 cells/uL.

E.  The Oral HIV test demonstrates that there is some risk of transmission from oral secretions.

###Answer:","D.  The seroconversion window period refers to the time from infection to the time when the laboratory is able to detect HIV antibodies.  Rationale: The seroconversion window period is the time between the initial infection with HIV and the point at which the virus can be detected by laboratory tests, specifically the presence of HIV antibodies. This period typically ranges from 3 to 12 weeks, during which time the individual may be infected but will test negative for HIV antibodies. It is important for healthcare providers to understand this concept to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of HIV infection.

Rationale: Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which produces an enterotoxin that stimulates the secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen. This results in a massive loss of fluids and electrolytes, leading to the characteristic secretory diarrhea seen in cholera. The mechanism is primarily due to the action of the cholera toxin, which activates adenylate cyclase and increases cyclic AMP levels in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to an outpouring of isotonic fluid into the gut lumen.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7455628,0.846828,0.79297554

These granulomas are composed of macrophages, lymphocytes, and other immune cells that have gathered in response to the infection. The presence of these granulomas is a hallmark of the body's immune response to the bacteria. The other options are incorrect because Mycobacteria tuberculosis is an aerobic, non-spore forming, non-motile bacillus, not a coccus.

Ivermectin works by increasing the permeability of the parasite's cell membrane, leading to paralysis and death of the microfilariae. It is administered orally and has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in humans. The World Health Organization recommends ivermectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis, and it has been used in mass drug administration programs in affected areas. Other options such as Praziquantel, Dapsone, DEC, and Doxycycline are not the preferred treatments for Onchocerciasis.

The correct answer is ALT (Alanine transaminase). In acute liver disease, there is a significant increase in serum ALT levels, which is more than 10 times the upper limit of normal. In contrast, in chronic liver disease, ALT levels are only slightly elevated or normal. AST (Aspartate transaminase) levels may also be elevated in acute liver disease, but the increase is not as marked as that of ALT. Alkaline phosphatase levels may be elevated in both acute and chronic liver disease due to cholestasis.

###Answer:","B.  P. Faciparum can remain dormant in the intrahepatic cells for months and later activate to cause clinical relapse.  Rationale: P. falciparum can remain dormant in the intrahepatic cells for months and later activate to cause clinical relapse. This is because the hypnozoite form of the parasite can remain in the liver for extended periods of time before initiating another cycle of infection. This is in contrast to P. vivax and P. ovale, which can also form hypnozoites but typically do not remain dormant for as long. The other options are incorrect because clinical symptoms of malaria typically begin when the parasite sporozoites invade the liver cells, not the hepatic parenchymal cells.

These lesions are characterized by the presence of cavities filled with fluid or pus, which can be seen on imaging studies such as chest X-rays or CT scans. In contrast, strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, filariasis, and helminthiasis do not commonly cause cavitary lung lesions. Strongyloidiasis and ascariasis are intestinal nematode infections that primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract, while filariasis is a blood-borne infection that affects the lymphatic system.

###Answer:","A.  Leprosy

Rationale: Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes. In the eye, leprosy can cause a condition called lagophthalmos, which is the inability to close the eyelids completely. This can lead to exposure keratitis, a condition where the cornea becomes damaged due to constant exposure to the air and lack of lubrication. The Orbicularis oculi muscle, which is responsible for closing the eyelids, can be paralyzed in leprosy, further contributing to lagophthalmos.

Rationale: The clinical presentation of widespread papules, exudative lesions on the face, scalp, and trunk, along with vesicles on the palms and soles, is highly suggestive of scabies. The history of itchy lesions in the mother also supports this diagnosis, as scabies is known to be highly contagious and can be transmitted through close contact. Infantile eczema and infantile seborrheic dermatitis typically present with more localized lesions and are not usually associated with vesicles on the palms and soles. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare, severe skin reaction that is not consistent with the described symptoms.

###Answer:","The rash appears af few days after the prodrome, starting at the head an moving caudad is not true of measles. The rash typically appears 3-4 days after the prodrome, starting on the face and then spreading downwards.  Rationale: The prodrome of measles includes symptoms such as fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, which are followed by the appearance of Koplick's spots (small white spots with blue-white centers on a red background) a few days later. The rash then develops and spreads from the head downwards, typically taking 2-3 days to reach its peak.

###Question: Tetanus

###Options:
A.  is caused by clostridium tetani endotoxin
B.  is associated with a better prognosis if the incubation period is short
C.  can manifest as rigidity of muscles in close proximity to the initial injury
D.  usually presents with weakness sin the extremities which then progresses to the facial muscles

###Answer:","C.  can manifest as rigidity of muscles in close proximity to the initial injury. Rationale: Tetanus is caused by the exotoxin of Clostridium tetani, not endotoxin. A shorter incubation period does not necessarily indicate a better prognosis, as the severity of the disease is more dependent on the amount of toxin produced. Tetanus can indeed manifest as rigidity of muscles in close proximity to the initial injury, which is known as local tetanus. It does not typically present with weakness in the extremities that then progresses to the facial muscles.

Rationale:  Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter are all bacterial pathogens that can cause gastroenteritis. These bacteria can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. In some cases, these infections can be severe and require medical attention. Antibiotics are often prescribed for these infections to help eliminate the bacteria and reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Giardia and E.coli, on the other hand, are not typically treated with antibiotics.

Rationale: The statement that the skin and subcutaneous tissue are often kept open for delayed closure is not true in the treatment for typhoid perforation. In typhoid perforation, the primary goal is to control the infection and prevent further complications. Delayed closure of the wound is not a standard practice as it can lead to increased risk of infection and other complications. The other options are true in the management of typhoid perforation. Perforation in the first week has a worse prognosis due to the patient's compromised nutritional and immunological status.

###Answer:","D. G6PD deficiency

Rationale: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common cause of neonatal anemia in Nigeria. It is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects the red blood cells' ability to protect themselves against oxidative stress. Newborns with G6PD deficiency may develop anemia due to the breakdown of red blood cells, which can be triggered by certain foods, infections, or medications.

Rationale: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that can cause chronic inflammation and scarring in the urinary tract, leading to painless haematuria. The prevalence of 30% in a rural primary school suggests a high level of exposure to the parasite, which is commonly found in contaminated water sources in endemic areas. Nephroblastoma (A) typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and haematuria, but it is less likely to cause painless haematuria. Cystitis (B) can cause haematuria, but it is usually associated with symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and dysuria. Renal vein thrombosis (D) is a rare condition that can cause haematuria, but it is more likely to present with flank pain and tenderness.

D.  It is a sex-linked disorder.

###Answer:","B. Both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation.  Rationale: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to be affected by the disease. The mutation is in the beta-globin gene, and individuals with one normal copy and one mutated copy are carriers, not affected by the disease. The most common variant of SCD is caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene, not a nonsense mutation.

###Answer:","C.  Haemoglobinuria

Rationale: In severe falciparum malaria, the presence of asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum on blood film is associated with complications such as haemoglobinuria, which is the most likely finding in this child. Haemoglobinuria is a result of the destruction of red blood cells, leading to the release of haemoglobin into the plasma.

These tumors arise from the surface epithelium of the ovary and can be further classified into serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, and Brenner types. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type and has a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of about 30%. In contrast, germ cell tumors and stromal cell tumors are less common and have a better prognosis. The peak age incidence is in the 60s, not 80–90 years old, and the incidence is higher in developed countries, not developing countries.

###Answer:","D. Tetanus toxoid

Rationale: Tetanus toxoid is the vaccine that is effective in the prevention of neonatal tetanus. It is part of the pentavalent vaccine, which also includes diphtheria, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) antigens. The vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies against the tetanus toxin, providing immunity against the disease. The other options, such as pentavalent I, II, and III, anti-Tetanus serum, and measles, do not specifically target neonatal tetanus prevention. Measles is a different viral infection, and while it is important for overall child health, it does not prevent tetanus.
