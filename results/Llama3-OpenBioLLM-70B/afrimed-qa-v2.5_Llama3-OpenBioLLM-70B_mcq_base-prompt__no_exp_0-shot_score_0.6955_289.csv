E.  Isoniazid prophylaxis is indicated for patients with a CD4 < 100 cells/uL.

###Answer: The correct letter option is "," B.  Active TB accelerates HIV disease. Explanation: The concurrence of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV infection significantly exacerbates the disease progression of both infections. Active TB is known to accelerate HIV disease for several reasons. Firstly, TB increases the expression of HIV RNA and decreases CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, leading to a more rapid progression of HIV disease. This is partly due to the inflammatory response induced by TB, which creates an environment conducive to HIV replication and reduces the immune system",B,True

A.  Zone 1
B.  Zone 2
C.  Zone 3
D.  None of the above
E.  All of the above

###Answer: The correct letter option is "," C. Explanation: The yellow fever virus predominantly affects Zone 3 of the hepatic acinus. This zone is characterized as the centrilobular region, which is in close proximity to the central vein of the hepatic lobule. The virus's tropism for this specific zone leads to significant hepatocellular injury and death, contributing to the clinical manifestations of yellow fever.
