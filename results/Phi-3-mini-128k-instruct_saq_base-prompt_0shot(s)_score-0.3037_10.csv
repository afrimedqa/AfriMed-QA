Additionally, socioeconomic factors may limit access to growth hormone replacement therapy.","The following are short answer questions(SAQs).
You should directly answer the question by providing a short answer and then provide a rationale for your answer.

Question: In what ways does the presentation of growth hormone deficiency vary between developing countries and developed nations?","Variation in diagnosis and treatment: Developed nations may have more resources for diagnosis and treatment, leading to earlier detection and management. Rationale: Developed countries typically have better healthcare infrastructure and access to medical technology, which facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of growth hormone deficiency.

Differences in awareness and education: Developing countries may have lower awareness and understanding of growth hormone deficiency among healthcare providers and the general population. Rationale: Developed nations often have more extensive health education programs and better dissemination of medical knowledge, leading to increased awareness and understanding of various health conditions, including growth hormone deficiency.

Socioeconomic factors: In developing countries, socioeconomic factors may contribute to delayed diagnosis and treatment due to limited access to healthcare services. Rationale: Lower income levels and limited healthcare infrastructure in developing countries can result in reduced access to medical care, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment of growth hormone deficiency.

Cultural beliefs and practices: Cultural beliefs and practices may influence the perception and management of growth hormone deficiency in developing countries. Rationale: Cultural factors can affect how health conditions are perceived and managed, potentially leading to differences in the presentation and treatment of growth hormone deficiency between developing and developed nations.",0.3114754062120398,0.1513513484902849,0.3114754062120398,0.8500545,0.90221685,0.87535924
5e29a3a9994141b38b437ecc820603d04d221ccf7a79367495ea33db5d8ad4c6,Question: Discuss the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of psoriasis. How is it diagnosed and managed?,"Answer: Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, leading to thickened, scaly plaques. The immune system mistakenly targets healthy skin cells, triggering inflammation. Clinically, psoriasis presents as well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales. Diagnosis involves clinical examination and, if necessary, skin biopsy for confirmation. Management includes topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, and systemic agents like methotrexate or biologics, tailored to the severity of the condition.

Rationale : This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the etiology, clinical features, diagnostic approach, and treatment options for psoriasis, which are fundamental in dermatology.
