### Input:
###Question: Which of the following statements accurately reflects the management approach for a 62-year-old obese woman with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who experiences vaginal bleeding for the first time since her menopause 11 years ago?
###Options:
A. She probably has fibroids
B. The woman's symptoms are most likely due to the presence of an arteriovenous malformation in the uterine wall.
C. She should undergo evaluation with a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound, and referral for endometrial sampling is necessary.
D. She has engaged in energetic sexual intercourse
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: She should undergo evaluation with a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound, and referral for endometrial sampling is necessary.

The patient's symptoms of vaginal bleeding are concerning for endometrial cancer, which is more common in postmenopausal women with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. The patient's age, obesity, and hypertension are all risk factors for endometrial cancer. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women with postmenopausal bleeding should undergo evaluation with a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound, and referral for endometrial sampling is necessary. Endometrial sampling is a procedure in which a biopsy is taken of the endometrium to determine if there is evidence of malignancy.

The other options are less likely causes for the patient's symptoms. Fibroids typically do not cause postmenopausal bleeding. The presence of an arteriovenous malformation in the uterine wall is unlikely to cause vaginal bleeding. Sexual intercourse is a possible cause of vaginal bleeding, but it is less likely to cause postmenopausal bleeding. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes make her a high-risk patient for endometrial cancer.

###Question: 51-year-old man with a 10-year history of gastroesophageal reflux and suspected Barrett esophagus comes to the office because his omeprazole dose ""doesn't work around the Christmas holidays."" He states that he prides himself on having a large appetite and ""holding his liquor"" during the holidays. He currently takes the maximum dose of omeprazole. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?
###Options:
A. Ask the patient how much he is eating and drinking during the holidays
B. Explain the hazards of untreated reflux in the presence of Barrett esophagus
C. Order an upper endoscopy
D. Switch the omeprazole to pantoprazole
E. Refer the patient to a gastroenterologist


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Ask the patient how much he is eating and drinking during the holidays. This patient's omeprazole dose does not work because he is excessively indulging in his holiday traditions, which include large amounts of food and alcohol. The patient's excessive consumption of food and alcohol is likely causing his reflux symptoms to worsen, despite his maximum dose of omeprazole. The first step in managing this patient is to educate him about the risks of untreated reflux in the presence of Barrett esophagus. This will help him understand the importance of modifying his holiday drinking and eating habits. The patient should also be encouraged to see his primary care physician or gastroenterologist for follow-up. Switching the omeprazole to another PPI is not indicated unless the patient has had a previous adverse reaction to omeprazole. Referral to a gastroenterologist is not necessary at this point.

A. Psychological
B. Hyperviscosity syndrome
C. Raynoud's phenomona
D. Painful peripheral neuropathy
E. Referred pain from the back


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodic digital ischaemia, typically affecting the fingers, toes and ears. It is often associated with a positive ruborv sphenicus (Raynaud's sign), whereby the affected area becomes red and warm during a attack. The symptoms are caused by spasm of digital aerioles, leading to a decrease in blood flow and subsequent ischaemia. The symptoms are typically triggered by cold or emotional stress. The patient's symptoms of bilateral leg pain, paicularly affecting the distal extremities, and the sensation of ‘walking on cotton wool’ are typical of Raynaud's phenomenon. The absence of pulses and the decreased light touch and joint position sense distally are consistent with the involvement of the digital aerioles.

###Question: Before intercourse, a woman irrigates her vagina with a solution that lowers the pH of the vaginal fluid to 4.5. What will be the effect on sperm cells in the vaginal?
###Options:
A. Metabolic rate will increase
B. Rate of movement will decrease
C. Formation of prostaglandin E2 will increase
D. Rate of oxygen consumption will increase
E. None of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: Rate of movement will decrease. The pH of the vaginal fluid is an important factor in determining the survival of sperm cells. The pH of the vaginal fluid is normally between 4.0 and 4.5. A vaginal fluid with a pH of 4.5 will kill sperm cells in a few minutes. The pH of the vaginal fluid is lowered by lactic acid produced by the action of Lactobacillus acidophilus. The movement of sperm cells is greatly affected by the concentration of cations such as potassium and calcium. The low pH of the vaginal fluid will cause a decrease in the movement of sperm cells.

### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: Bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. The malaria parasite is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasite develops in the human red blood cells, and the infection can cause a wide range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal. The parasite's life cycle begins when a mosquito ingests the parasite's sporozoites during a blood meal. The parasite then develops in the mosquito's salivary gland and is transmitted to humans during the bite. Once in the human bloodstream, the parasite matures into the trophozoite stage and then into the schizont stage. The schizonts are the infectious form of the parasite. The symptoms described in the question stem are typical of malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium falciparum.

B. Repeat the purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test.
C. Initiate tuberculosis therapy.
D. Obtain a chest radiograph.
E. Obtain a chest ultrasound


### Response: The correct answer is"," C: Initiate tuberculosis therapy.

The patient's history and physical exam findings are suggestive of active tuberculosis. The induration of 10 mm on the purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test indicates a positive tuberculosis infection test. The CDC recommends treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in those with a positive PPD skin test, although the patient in this case has active disease and should be started on treatment without further testing.

The next step in the management of this patient would be to initiate tuberculosis therapy. The most common regimen for active tuberculosis is isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (known as the RECAP regimen). Other regimens may be used based on drug availability and patient tolerance.

### Input:
###Question: A 58-year-old man was brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a stab wound on the right upper posterior chest. The patient was unresponsive at the presentation. His past history includes coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft two years ago, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension. Vitals upon triage were blood pressure of 89/53 mmHg, a pulse of 155/min, respiratory rate of 36/min, and oxygen saturation of 82% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient was intubated for airway protection and given a 2-liter bolus of lactated Ringer's solution. He was started on phenylephrine. On physical examination, the patient appeared pale, cyanotic, diaphoretic, and in acute respiratory distress. Cardiovascular examination was positive for sinus tachycardia with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the right with hyper-resonant percussion sounds. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?
###Options:
A. Consult thoracic surgery
B. Obtain a STAT X-ray
C. Perform needle decompression
D. Continue to monitor
E. Consult internal medicine


### Response: The correct answer is"," C: Perform needle decompression. This patient's presentation is consistent with tension pneumothorax, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. Tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space with enough pressure to collapse the lung, leading to compression of the mediastinum and subsequent decreased venous return to the heart. This can lead to hemodynamic instability, as seen in this patient with hypotension and tachycardia. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent cardiac arrest. The initial management of tension pneumothorax involves needle decompression, which involves placing a large-bore needle into the pleural space to release the negative pressure and prevent further accumulation of air. This procedure is performed in the emergency department and does not require advanced imaging or specialized equipment. Imaging studies can be obtained at a later time once the patient is hemodynamically stable.

###Options:
A. hypertension

C. hyperkakaemia
D. cough
E. option A and C are correct


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, hyperkalemia. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are a class of medications used to treat high blood pressure and hea failure. They work by blocking an enzyme that helps conve the angiotensin I hormone into the more potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. By blocking this enzyme, ACE inhibitors prevent the formation of angiotensin II, which results in vasodilation, increased excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, and a reduction in blood pressure. ACE inhibitors also reduce the production of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates sodium and water balance in the body. Common side effects of ACE inhibitors include cough, angioedema, dysguesia (altered taste), hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal impairment.

###Question: A 22-year-old woman is evaluated during a routine evaluation. She has no medical problems except for feeling tired all the time, which she attributes to working part-time while attending classes full-time and her many social activities. She denies depression, anhedonia, or constipation, and, although she has not gained weight, she has not lost any weight despite being on a diet for years. She has occasional heartburn, particularly after alcohol consumption, which she successfully self-treats two to three times per week with calcium carbonate, 500 mg. She admits to occasional binge drinking, once or twice yearly, but her CAGE score is 0/4. She smokes because it helps her to control her weight. On physical examination, she is slightly overweight, with a BMI of 27. Her heart rate is 68/min and her blood pressure is 188/62 mm Hg. The oropharynx is remarkable for an excoriation at the back of the throat and mild bilateral parotid gland swelling. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. Complete blood count and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level are unremarkable. Serum electrolytes are notable for mildly decreased serum potassium, slightly elevated serum bicarbonate, and mildly decreased serum chloride levels. The serum creatinine/blood urea nitrogen levels, liver chemistry tests, and urinalysis are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Bulimia nervosa
B. Anorexia nervosa
C. Primary aldosteronism
D. Surreptitious diuretic ingestion
E. Renal tubular acidosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Bulimia nervosa. This young woman's history of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting, coupled with the physical findings of an excoriation in the back of the throat and bilateral parotid gland swelling, is highly suggestive of bulimia nervosa. The patient's normal complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and liver chemistry tests are reassuring for any significant organ damage from her behaviors. The patient's slightly elevated serum bicarbonate level is likely secondary to rebound alkalosis from her vomiting. The patient's slightly decreased serum potassium level is likely due to her chronic vomiting and subsequent loss of potassium. The patient's slightly decreased serum chloride level is likely due to her chronic vomiting and subsequent loss of chloride.

###Question: A 7-year-old girl is brought to the office with vision problems. Her mother noticed that her daughter goes close to the television and cries when she is stopped. This started a few months ago, along with a few episodes of vomiting. Otherwise, she is a playful and active child who is achieving all her milestones. The physical examination reveals papilledema but no neurological deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain shows a well-defined, poorly enhanced, and hypointense mass. Which of the following describes the histopathology of the most likely condition in this child?
###Options:
A. Fried egg appearance
B. Whorling pattern with psammoma bodies
C. Central necrosis with peripheral vascularization
D. Little cytoplasm with clusters and rosettes
E. frotty appearance


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Little cytoplasm with clusters and rosettes. The description of the histopathology of the most likely condition in this child is that of medulloblastoma, specifically the classic variant. Medulloblastoma is a malignant tumor of the cerebellum that most commonly occurs in children. It is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, accounting for about 20% of all childhood brain tumors. It is a rapidly growing tumor that often causes symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, vomiting, and papilledema. The histopathology of medulloblastoma is characterized by small, round cells with scant cytoplasm and clusters and rosettes of cells. The tumor cells are often positive for neuron-specific enolase, a marker of neuroendocrine differentiation. The whorling pattern with psammoma bodies is seen in meningiomas. The frothy appearance is seen in pineal parenchymal tumors. Central necrosis with peripheral vascularization is seen in glioblastoma.

### Input:
###Question: A 4-year-old boy presents for a routine checkup. He is asymptomatic, and his mother has no specific concerns about her son's health. The family lives in a house that was built in 1929 and is currently undergoing renovation. Vital Signs are heart rate 100 bpm, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, temperature 98.6° F (37° C), and blood pressure 86/66 mm Hg. Physical examination is notable for marked pallor. A complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL. Peripheral blood smear reveals microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with basophilic stippling. Which of the following complications is this patient likely to experience?
###Options:
A. Leukemia
B. Cognitive deficits
C. Pathological fractures
D. Abdominal bleeding
E. Fainting episodes


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: Pathological fractures.

The child's presentation is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, which is commonly seen in children due to poor dietary intake, inadequate iron absorption, or chronic blood loss. The child's symptoms of fatigue, pallor, and tachycardia are consistent with anemia. The microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with basophilic stippling seen on peripheral blood smear are also characteristic of iron deficiency anemia.

Iron deficiency anemia can lead to a range of complications, including cognitive deficits, fainting episodes, and abdominal bleeding. However, the most serious complication of iron deficiency anemia is pathological fractures. Iron is essential for the production of collagen, which provides strength and elasticity to bones. In the context of iron deficiency, the bones become weak and brittle, increasing the risk of fractures.

###Options:
A. Hysterectomy
B. Cervical cerclage
C. Vesicovaginal fistula repair
D. Oophorectomy
E. None of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Obstetricians and gynecologists in developing countries should be prepared to perform simple repairs of obstetric fistulas whenever possible. The most common obstetric fistulas are vesicovaginal fistulas, which occur when the bladder is injured during a prolonged obstructed labor. The injury may be caused by the bladder itself or by the cervix or the symphysis pubis. The fistula is usually located in the anterior vaginal wall. The fistula may be small and only allow urine to dribble from the external urethral orifice. In other cases, the fistula is large and continuous with the bladder. The latter type of fistula is termed an ""open fistula."" The incidence of vesicovaginal fistulas is approximately 1 in 1,000 deliveries in the United States, whereas the incidence in developing countries is as high as 1 in 25 deliveries. The obstetric fistula is a major cause of morbidity for women in developing countries. The fistula may be associated with incontinence of urine and stool, recurrent urinary tract infections, and secondary infertility. The obstetric fistula is a condition that can be treated surgically. The surgical treatment of vesicovaginal fistulas is relatively simple. The fistula is located in the anterior vaginal wall, and the bladder is entered through the urethra. The bladder is entered through the urethra, and the fistula tract is excised. The bladder is closed with a simple suture, and the vaginal wall is repaired with a simple suture. The fistula tract is excised, and the vaginal and bladder openings are closed with simple sutures. The surgical treatment of obstetric fistulas is relatively simple.

### Response: The correct answer is"," phenylephrine. Phenylephrine is a selective alpha-1 agonist that increases blood pressure without affecting the hea rate. It is often used in the management of patients with cardiovascular collapse. The use of phenylephrine in this setting is appropriate because it raises blood pressure without increasing hea rate and has a positive inotropic effect. Dopamine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, and norepinephrine all increase hea rate and cardiac contractility and therefore are not appropriate for this patient.

###Question:  A 60-year-old African patient presents with a history of chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. Colonoscopy reveals multiple, discrete, ulcerated lesions throughout the colon. Biopsy demonstrates non-caseating granulomas. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?
###Options:
A. Crohn's disease
B. Ulcerative colitis
C. Diverticulitis
D. Colorectal carcinoma
E. Ischemic colitis


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Crohn's disease. The presence of non-caseating granulomas in the setting of chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea is highly suggestive of Crohn's disease. This condition is characterized by transmural inflammation that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. The most common sites of involvement are the terminal ileum and the colon. The presence of discrete, ulcerated lesions throughout the colon is also characteristic of Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation limited to the colon. Diverticulitis is a condition that is characterized by the presence of diverticula in the colon. These are outpouchings of the colonic mucosa through the muscularis propria. The inflammation associated with diverticulitis is usually confined to the area around the diverticula. Colorectal carcinoma is a possibility in any patient with chronic abdominal pain and weight loss. However, the presence of non-caseating granulomas makes this diagnosis less likely. Ischemic colitis is a condition that is characterized by decreased blood flow to the colon. This can result in ischemic necrosis of the colonic mucosa. However, the presence of discrete, ulcerated lesions throughout the colon is not typical of ischemic colitis.

###Question: A 79yr old gentleman presents with a 1 day history of palpitations and light headedness to A&E. He states he has had similar episodes over the last few years, but they always went away after a short time and were never this bad. His BP is 146/81, and pulse rate 120bpm. Chest is clear, heart sounds normal but his pulse is irregularly irregular. There is no peripheral oedema. He has a PMH of: IHD, HTN and gout. He is normally fit and well, and enjoys walking with his wife. ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, with no clear p waves. There are no obvious signs of ischaemia. Bloods and CXR grossly normal. What is the most suitable initial treatment for this man’s presentation?
###Options:
A. Aspirin 300mg and clopidogrel 300mg
B. Metoprolol 50mg
C. Digoxin 125microgram
D. Apixaban 5mg BD
E. Refer to cardiologist


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Digoxin 125 microgram:

The patient's presentation is consistent with atrial fibrillation (irregularly irregular rhythm, no clear p waves on ECG). He has a history of similar episodes that resolved spontaneously, but this time they have become significantly worse. Given his age, history of IHD and HTN, it is important to consider rate control as well as rhythm control. Digoxin is a commonly used rate control medication in atrial fibrillation. It reduces ventricular rate by decreasing the number of impulses that are able to pass down the A-V node. It is usually given as a loading dose of 1.25 mg, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5-1mg daily.

Aspirin and clopidogrel are not indicated in this patient as there is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These are used in the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome in patients with known CAD.

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, which is also used for rate control in AF. However, it is not the first-line choice in this patient due to his age and history of IHD.

Apixaban is an anticoagulant, commonly used in the management of AF. However, it is not indicated as an initial treatment for this patient as he has a history of IHD and is currently unstable.

The most suitable initial treatment for this patient's presentation is Digoxin 125 microgram. This will help to control his rate, as well as maintain rhythm. It is important to note that Digoxin is a temporary measure until the patient is more stable, and the goal is to eventually transition to a long-term rate control medication such as beta-blockers.

She states that her distress is so significant that she has not left her home in 6 months except to come to this appointment. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?
###Options:
A. Referral to cognitive behavioral therapy
B. Initiate amitriptyline or imipramine
C. Initiate sertraline or fluoxetine
D. Initiate propranolol or prazosin
E. Deep brain stimulation


### Response: The correct answer is"," A Referral to cognitive behavioral therapy. This patient's symptoms are suggestive of panic disorder, which is characterized by recurrent panic attacks and persistent concern about having additional panic attacks. Panic attacks are intense periods of fear or discomfort, often involving symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, and loss of control. The patient's inability to leave her home in 6 months is indicative of the severity of her symptoms and the need for treatment.

The first-line treatment for panic disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on identifying and modifying irrational thoughts and behaviors that contribute to panic attacks. Medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be used as an adjunct to CBT. However, CBT alone is often sufficient for many patients.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are indicative of panic disorder, which is a chronic condition. While pharmacological treatment can be effective in managing acute panic attacks, long-term treatment is often required to prevent relapses. However, the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant immediate pharmacological treatment. Therefore, the next best step is to refer the patient to CBT.

###Question: A 34-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of nasal congestion, sore throat, slight yellowing of his skin, and loss of appetite. His symptoms developed after returning from a hiking trip to Colorado. Vital signs are temperature 98.6 F (37 C), blood pressure 110/87 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 17 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on ambient air. Physical examination demonstrates mild jaundice and normal cardiopulmonary auscultation and is negative for hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, or peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease. Lab values are as follows: total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.1 mg/dL, LDH 120 U/L, ALT 20 U/L, AST 15 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 110 U/L. Hemoglobin is 16 g/dL, reticulocyte count 1%, and haptoglobin 125 mg/dL. Given the likely diagnosis, what is the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?
###Options:
A. Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin
B. Reduced copper excretion
C. Iron overload
D. Inflammation secondary to autoimmune liver disease
E. copper overload


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin. The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The most common form of Gilbert syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, which leads to reduced bilirubin uptake and increased excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in the bile. This condition is benign and asymptomatic, and patients do not require treatment. The patient's normal liver function tests and lack of stigmata of chronic liver disease make this diagnosis more likely. The other choices do not accurately describe the pathogenesis of Gilbert syndrome.

###Options:
A. Viral hepatitis
B. Positive anti-smooth muscle antibody
C. Raised IgM
D. Raised alpha-fetoprotein
E. Raised ferritin


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. Raised ferritin. The patient is presenting with features of both autoimmune hepatitis and pernicious anemia. The presence of anti-smooth muscle antibody is suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis, but the presence of a positive direct Coombs test is required for the diagnosis. The presence of anti-smooth muscle antibody indicates that the autoimmune response is directed against hepatocytes. The presence of IgM antibodies to the hepatitis viruses (hepatitis A, B and C) is suggestive of acute viral hepatitis, but the presence of IgM antibodies to the hepatitis viruses in the absence of a raised transaminase level is not diagnostic of acute viral hepatitis. The presence of a raised ferritin level is consistent with haemochromatosis, but the absence of a history of iron overload makes this unlikely. The presence of a raised alpha-fetoprotein level is consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma, but the absence of a history of chronic liver disease makes this unlikely.

###Question: A 56-year-old man with a history of heavy smoking presents with a persistent productive cough and progressive shortness of breath. A pulmonary examination reveals decreased breath sounds and scattered wheezes. Based on this patient's history and physical examination, which of the following is the most likely physiological defect on pulmonary function testing?
###Options:
A. Increase in residual volume
B. Decrease in tidal volume
C. Increase in vital capacity
D. Decrease in total lung capacity
E. Increase in minute ventilation


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D Decrease in total lung capacity. The patient's history of heavy smoking, persistent cough, and progressive shortness of breath are all suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterized by a decrease in total lung capacity, which is the combination of FEV1 and FVC. The FEV1 and FVC values are both decreased in COPD, but the decrease in FEV1 is greater than the decrease in FVC. This results in a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. The forced expiratory flow rate (FEFR) is also decreased in COPD. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the most important measure of COPD. It is decreased in COPD, and the FEV1 is the best predictor of mortality in COPD patients. The forced vital capacity (FVC) is also decreased in COPD, but to a lesser degree than FEV1. The FEV1 and FVC are both decreased in COPD, but the decrease in FEV1 is greater than the decrease in FVC. This results in a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. The forced expiratory flow rate (FEFR) is also decreased in COPD.

### Input:
###Question: A 64-year-old man presents with the complaint of a worsening cough. The patient has had a cough with a small amount of sputum for several years. Over the past 12 months, he has observed an increase in the severity of cough and sputum production. On physical examination, chest auscultation is unremarkable. The patient reports that he has stopped going out for a walk because it left him breathless. Medical records show the patient has had 4 respiratory infections over the past 14 months, each requiring hospitalization. The patient has a 40-year history of smoking 1.5 packs per day and alcohol use disorder for 10 years. The patient has had multiple failed attempts at quitting smoking with pharmacological intervention. He has quit alcohol successfully and attends peer-led mutual aid fellowship meetings regularly. This breathlessness had made it difficult for him to leave the house. Over the past months, he has been hospitalized 3 times. At rest, the pulse oximeter shows a saturation of 91%, but it drops to 82% rapidly when the patient walks a couple of steps. His recent lab investigations reveal increased red blood cell (RBC) mass. Which of the following is the next best step?
###Options:
A. Phlebotomy with a hematocrit goal of less than 55%
B. Smoking cessation
C. Tiotropium inhaler
D. High-resolution chest computed tomography
E. exercise


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: High-resolution chest computed tomography. This patient's progressive exertional dyspnea, increased sputum production, and evidence of polycythemia on laboratory investigations are concerning for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's smoking history and multiple failed attempts at smoking cessation suggest that he is not motivated to quit. The patient's exercise capacity is also severely reduced, as evidenced by his difficulty in leaving the house and his need to stop after only a few steps.

Option A: Phlebotomy with a hematocrit goal of less than 55% is not appropriate for this patient. While an elevated hematocrit can be seen in patients with COPD, it is not the primary issue in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more significant underlying pathology.

Option B: Tiotropium inhaler is a bronchodilator commonly used in the management of COPD. While it may provide symptomatic relief, it does not address the underlying pathology in this patient. The presence of polycythemia suggests a more significant pathology, such as lung cancer, that requires further investigation.

Option C: Exercise is an important component of pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD. However, in this patient, the severity of his symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that he is not currently able to tolerate exercise. Therefore, it is not the next best step.

Option D: High-resolution chest computed tomography is the next best step in this patient's evaluation. The patient's progressive exertional dyspnea, increased sputum production, and evidence of polycythemia on laboratory investigations are concerning for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). High-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and staging COPD. It can help identify emphysema, which is a common cause of COPD. Additionally, HRCT can help differentiate COPD from other causes of chronic cough and dyspnea, such as lung cancer.

###Question: A 66-year-old woman complains of stiffness and weakness climbing stairs. She has a history of hypertension and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes. On examination, there is mild upper arm weakness, hip flexion is 4−/5 bilaterally, with bilateral wasting and flickers of fasciculations in the right quadriceps. Knee extension is 4/5. Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are strong. Brisk knee and ankle reflexes are elicited, as well as a positive Hoffman’s and Babinski’s sign. Sensory examination and cranial nerves are normal. Her BM is 8.9, her pulse is regular and her blood pressure is 178/97. What is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Diabetic neuropathy
C. Myositis
D. Motor neurone disease
E. Multiple sclerosis (MS)


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Motor neurone disease. This patient has a slowly progressive motor neurone disease, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This is characterised by progressive muscle weakness, atrophy and fasciculations. The disease typically affects the motor neurones of the cranial nerves, brainstem and spinal cord, leading to progressive weakness of bulbar and spinal musculature. The disease is usually spinal, but may present with only bulbar symptoms. The disease is invariably fatal, with a median survival of 24 months from diagnosis.

###Question: Mrs Ezekwu, a 77-year-old widow was brought in by her daughter in-law. She presented to the emergency department with significant and progressive right-sided jaw pain that began a few days ago. She had undergone a tooth extraction 2 to 3 months ago. On exam, there was evidence of gingival swelling and erythema around the area of her vacated tooth. Complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and plain radiographs of the area were unremarkable. She has a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and breast adenocarcinoma with bony metastases. She has been taking the following medications for the last two years: lisinopril, amlodipine, metformin, glipizide, and denosumab.

###Question:  A 15-year-old girl is brought to the office because she has never had a menstrual period. She has no history of serious illness and receives no medications. Growth and development are appropriate for age. Breast development began at the age of 10 years. She has never been sexually active. She is at the 90th percentile for height, 75th percentile for weight, and 69th percentile for BMI. Sexual maturity rating is 4 for breast development. Pelvic examination shows a normal-appearing vagina; the cervix and uterus cannot be palpated. Her serum testosterone concentration is 340 ng/dL (N=5–40). Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and prolactin are within the reference ranges. Serum β-hCG testing is negative. Pelvic ultrasonography shows no uterus. Her karyotype is 46,XY. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
###Options:
A. Estrogen and progestin therapy
B. Gonadectomy
C. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy
D. Progestin therapy only
E. No further management is indicated


### Response: The correct answer is"," B: Gonadectomy. This patient has a 46,XY karyotype with a normal female phenotype and a history of primary amenorrhea. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of testicular feminization, an androgen insensitivity syndrome. In these patients, the testes produce excess androgen, which leads to a female phenotype but with insufficiently high levels of estrogen to induce normal secondary sexual characteristics. The high levels of androgen also lead to a functional testosterone-induced moustache and beard.

In these patients, the testes are located in the abdomen or inguinal canal, and surgical removal of the gonads (gonadectomy) is the treatment of choice. This is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.

Options A and C are not appropriate choices. Estrogen and progestin therapy would not be effective in this patient because the problem is a lack of estrogen, not a lack of androgens. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy is used to suppress the release of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) and would not be effective in this patient because the problem is a lack of estrogen, not a lack of gonadotropins. Progestin therapy only would not address the underlying issue of a lack of estrogen and would not be effective in this patient.

###Question: A previously healthy 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue, constipation, and frequent urination. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Diffuse crackles are heard bilaterally. Her serum calcium concentration is 11.1 mg/dL, and serum parathyroid hormone concentration is decreased. A chest x-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and interstitial infiltrates. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hypercalcemia
###Options:
A. Calcitriol production by activated macrophages
B. Local resorption of bone by metastases
C. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide secretion
D. Secretion of parathyroid hormone
E. Secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Calcitriol production by activated macrophages. This patient's symptoms of fatigue, constipation, and frequent urination are suggestive of hypercalcemia, which is a condition characterized by elevated calcium levels in the blood. The most common cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands. This excessive PTH production and secretion leads to increased bone resorption, which releases calcium into the bloodstream. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, constipation, and frequent urination are likely due to the increased calcium levels in the blood. The decreased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in this patient are likely due to the increased PTH secretion by the parathyroid glands in response to the hypercalcemia. This increased PTH secretion leads to negative feedback on the parathyroid glands, which decreases their PTH production. The decreased PTH levels in turn lead to decreased calcium absorption from the kidneys, resulting in increased calcium levels in the blood. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, constipation, and frequent urination are consistent with the symptoms of hypercalcemia. The patient's bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is also suggestive of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause lymph node enlargement, and the patient's hilar lymphadenopathy may be due to the increased calcium levels in the blood. The patient's diffuse crackles on lung examination are also suggestive of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause pulmonary complications such as diffuse crackles on lung examination. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, constipation, and frequent urination are consistent with the symptoms of hypercalcemia. The patient's bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is also suggestive of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause lymph node enlargement, and the patient's hilar lymphadenopathy may be due to the increased calcium levels in the blood. The patient's diffuse crackles on lung examination are also suggestive of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause pulmonary complications such as diffuse crackles on lung examination.

He has a 10-pack-year smoking history but takes no illicit drugs. He drinks alcohol on occasion and weekends. Past medical problems include hypertension and obesity. His BMI is 30 kg/m². He takes amlodipine and multivitamins. Family history is significant for sleep apnea in the father and diabetes mellitus in the mother. His manometry findings show mildly decreased peristalsis and a normal barium swallow. The chest x-ray is unremarkable. The basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. What is the underlying cause of this man’s symptoms?
###Options:
A. The upper esophageal sphincter fails to relax
B. Abnormal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter
C. The upper esophageal sphincter fails to contract
D. The upper esophageal sphincter fails to contract
E. none


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: The upper esophageal sphincter fails to relax. This is the classic presentation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient's symptoms of heartburn after meals are consistent with acid reflux. The normal barium swallow rules out structural abnormalities that could cause acid reflux, such as hiatal hernia or esophageal strictures. The normal chest x-ray also rules out obstructive causes of GERD, such as hiatal hernia or esophageal cancer.

Option B: Abnormal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) would result in increased acid reflux, but it would not cause heartburn specifically after meals. Option C: The upper esophageal sphincter fails to contract is a rare condition called achalasia, which would present with dysphagia rather than heartburn. Option D: The upper esophageal sphincter fails to relax is the correct answer. This is the classic presentation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

###Options:
A. Autosomal dominant
B. Autosomal recessive
C. X-linked recessive
D. X-linked dominant
E. Sporadic


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C X-linked recessive. The baby boy is suffering from neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots. The disease is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on the X chromosome. The NF1 gene is one of the largest genes in the genome, spanning 3 Mb. It encodes for a protein called neurofibromin, which is involved in the regulation of Ras signaling. The disease is typically inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The mother is a carrier of the disease, but since she is a female, she does not show any symptoms of the disease. The father is not a carrier, and since he is male, he does not pass the disease to his children.

The disease is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on the X chromosome. The NF1 gene is one of the largest genes in the genome, spanning 3 Mb. It encodes for a protein called neurofibromin, which is involved in the regulation of Ras signaling.

The NF1 gene is one of the largest genes in the genome, spanning 3 Mb. It encodes for a protein called neurofibromin, which is involved in the regulation of Ras signaling.

NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder. Autosomal dominant disorders are caused by a mutation in a single copy of a gene. In most cases, one copy of the gene (paternal or maternal) is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, in some cases, two copies of the gene (one from each parent) are needed to cause the disorder.

Autosomal recessive disorders are caused by a mutation in both copies of a gene (one from each parent). In most cases, both copies of the gene must be mutated for the disorder to develop. However, in some cases, only one copy of the gene is affected.

Autosomal recessive disorders are more common than autosomal dominant disorders. However, autosomal recessive disorders are more severe than autosomal dominant disorders.

Sporadic disorders are caused by a mutation in a single gene, but the gene mutation occurred in a person's parent's germ cells (egg or sperm cells). Sporadic disorders are not passed on to children.

Sporadic disorders are not inherited. They occur in people with no family history of the disorder.

### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Intradermal hyaluronidase. This patient is experiencing a reaction to extravasation of IV fluids, which is characterized by localized erythema, edema, and tenderness at the site of extravasation. Extravasation of IV fluids can be prevented by using tubing with a blunt needle and by using a Y-piece with a flow rate of 1-2 mL/hr. Treatment of extravasation injuries includes: Immediately stop the infusion and raise the affected limb. Apply warm compresses and elevate the affected limb. Infiltrate the area with sterile 1% lidocaine. If the extravasation is recent, aspirate the fluid and inject hyaluronidase 1500-2000 units into the affected area. If the extravasation is chronic, inject steroids (e.g., triamcinolone) into the affected area.

###Options:
A. Parkinson disease
B. Schizophrenia
C. Huntington disease
D. Depression
E. mania


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Parkinson disease. The patient's symptoms of headaches, changes in vision, strange discharge from her breasts, and papilledema are indicative of a neurological disorder. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Levodopa is the most appropriate medication for this condition. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and is converted into dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is depleted in Parkinson's disease. Levodopa helps to replenish dopamine levels in the brain and alleviate symptoms. Levodopa can also be used to treat motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease. 

Parkinson's disease is not typically treated with antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone, or aripiprazole. These medications are used to treat psychosis, which is not a symptom of Parkinson's disease.

Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and behavior, and social or occupational dysfunction. It is not typically treated with levodopa.

Huntington disease is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the brain's nerve cells. It is not typically treated with levodopa.

Depression and mania are mood disorders that are typically treated with antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). These medications work by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. Levodopa is not typically used to treat depression or mania.

###Question: A 55-year-old gentleman presents during the onset of the influenza season with symptoms including headache, malaise, and confusion. Upon assessment, his vital signs demonstrate a temperature of 98.7°F (38°C), a pulse rate of 110/min, a respiratory rate of 24/min, and a blood pressure of 155/92 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals clear lung fields, normal heart sounds, and a rosy appearance of the lips and skin. The patient exhibits slight confusion and is oriented solely to person. Initial tests for Influenza A and B antigens return negative results, with a normal complete blood count and unremarkable findings on plain chest radiography. In light of these findings, which additional diagnostic test would be most likely to elucidate the patient's underlying condition?
###Options:
A. Arterial blood gas
B. Pulse oximetry
C. Complete blood count
D. Electrocardiogram
E. CT of the head without contrast


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Pulse oximetry:

The patient's presentation of headache, malaise, confusion, and rosy appearance of the lips and skin is suggestive of hyperthermia. The vital signs of a temperature of 98.7°F (38°C), a pulse rate of 110/min, a respiratory rate of 24/min, and a blood pressure of 155/92 mm Hg are consistent with hyperthermia. Hyperthermia can be caused by various factors, including infection, malignancy, or drug overdose. The patient's presentation during the onset of the influenza season raises concern for influenza as a potential cause of hyperthermia.

The initial tests for Influenza A and B antigens return negative results, with a normal complete blood count and unremarkable findings on plain chest radiography. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are not related to an influenza infection. Therefore, further diagnostic testing is needed to elucidate the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Pulse oximetry is a diagnostic test used to measure oxygen saturation levels in arterial blood. It is used to assess oxygenation in patients with respiratory distress or those who are at risk for respiratory depression. In this case, the patient's presentation of confusion and headache raises concern for a neurological event, such as delirium or stroke. Pulse oximetry can help to assess for hypoxemia, which can be a sign of respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure. Therefore, this test would be most likely to elucidate the patient's underlying condition.

It is most common in patients over the age of 40 and is more common in women than men. The pain is typically worse with movement, especially with overhead activities. Physical examination may reveal tenderness over the AC joint and pain with cross-body adduction. Imaging reveals joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. The most common cause of adhesive capsulitis is idiopathic, but it can be associated with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, thyroid disease, and repetitive motion injuries. The most effective treatment is usually non-operative, including physical therapy, corticosteroid injections, and NSAIDs. Rotator cuff tear is a common cause of shoulder pain, but it is usually associated with a history of trauma and weakness in the shoulder. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that typically presents with pain and stiffness in the shoulder, but it is more common in the elderly. Subacromial bursitis is a bursitis of the bursa between the humerus and the acromion. It is usually associated with pain and tenderness over the acromion.

###Question: A 42-year-old woman is evaluated during a routine examination. She has been married and monogamous for 21 years. Her history includes celiac sprue, which was diagnosed at age 25 years and for which she maintains a gluten-free diet that limits her symptoms. She also has mild rosacea and frequent urinary tract infections. Her mother was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism, but the patient reports no fatigue or hot or cold intolerance, and she has had no changes in weight, hair, skin, and nails. The patient exercises regularly. She reports no polyuria or polydipsia. On physical examination, the patient is fair-skinned. BMI is 18.9, and weight has been stable. The pulse rate is 68/min, and blood pressure is 102/66 mm Hg. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?
###Options:
A. TSH measurement
B. Bone density test
C. Chalamydia trachomatis infection
D. Diabetes screening
E. Colon cancer screening


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Bone density test:

The patient's history of celiac sprue and the prolonged use of a gluten-free diet raises concern for nutritional deficiencies, particularly of calcium and vitamin D. The patient's symptoms of frequent urinary tract infections and mild rosacea may also suggest an underlying immune dysfunction. The patient's fair skin and light hair color are consistent with vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, a bone density test is indicated to evaluate for osteoporosis, which is a known complication of celiac disease and gluten-free diets.

The patient's other comorbidities, including celiac sprue, mild rosacea, and frequent urinary tract infections, are not associated with increased risk of osteoporosis. Therefore, these conditions do not warrant screening for osteoporosis.

Options A, C, and D are not appropriate for this patient. TSH measurement is not indicated in the absence of symptoms or signs of thyroid dysfunction. A colon cancer screening is not indicated in a patient without a personal or family history of colon cancer. Diabetes screening is not indicated in the absence of symptoms or signs of diabetes.

###Options:
A. Atenolol
B. Diltiazem
C. Enalapril
D. Hydralazine
E. Hydrochlorothiazide


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C, Enalapril. This is a case of gout, which is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. Medications that can increase uric acid levels, such as ACE inhibitors like enalapril, can precipitate gout. ACE inhibitors work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which leads to decreased levels of angiotensin II and increased levels of bradykinin. This increase in bradykinin leads to increased uric acid production, which can precipitate gout.

The other medications listed are not typically associated with increased uric acid levels and gout. Atenolol is a beta blocker that lowers uric acid levels, so it would be the opposite of what is seen in this case. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that can lower uric acid levels. Hydralazine is an antihypertensive that can lower uric acid levels. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can lower uric acid levels.

There is no history of alcohol consumption, smoking, or illicit drug use. Vital signs are blood pressure 110/64 mmg, heart rate 98 bpm, and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. On physical examination, she is drowsy and confused, her thyroid is normal in size, and her abdomen is nontender and consistent with gestational age. The neurologic exam reveals a coarse tremor in the upper limbs and downbeat nystagmus. Laboratory tests show blood glucose of 150 mg/dL, WBC count of 10000/µL, BUN level of 22 mg/dL, and a normal coagulation profile. Which of the following coexisting conditions can lead to this presentation?
###Options:
A. Diabetes mellitus
B. Hyperthyroidism
C. Acute fulminant hepatitis
D. Dehydration
E. Hypothyroidism


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B, hyperthyroidism. This patient's symptoms of drowsiness, confusion, nausea, and vomiting, along with signs of tremor, downbeat nystagmus, and elevated heart rate, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can lead to a hyperadrenergic state, which can cause hea failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. This can manifest as dyspnea, orthopnea, and signs of pulmonary congestion, such as crackles and rales on examination. The elevated heart rate is due to increased sympathetic tone, leading to increased cardiac contractility and heart rate. The hypermetabolic state can lead to dehydration, which can cause elevated blood glucose levels, but it would not explain the neurologic symptoms of tremor and nystagmus. Diabetes mellitus can cause dysglycemia, but it would not explain the other symptoms. Acute fulminant hepatitis can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, but it would not explain the neurologic symptoms of tremor and nystagmus. Hypothyroidism can cause symptoms of fatigue and cognitive slowing, but it would not explain the other symptoms.

The patient's symptoms of intermittent facial and limb jerks, along with the EEG findings of polyspike and wave discharges, are indicative of absence seizures. Typical treatment for absence seizures is sodium valproate, which is why it is the correct answer here.

Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that is often used as an adjunctive treatment for seizures, but it is not the initial treatment of choice for absence seizures. Topiramate is also an antiepileptic drug, but it is not typically used as the initial treatment for absence seizures. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are antiepileptic drugs used to treat generalized tonic–clonic seizures and focal seizures, respectively, but they are not the initial treatment of choice for absence seizures.

###Options:
A. Wound infection
B. Bacterial resistance to current antibiotic therapy
C. Intra-abdominal collection
D. Urinary Tract Infection
E. Lower lobe pneumonia


### Response: The correct answer is"," Lower lobe pneumonia. The child's symptoms of fever, diarrhoea and cough are consistent with a lower respiratory tract infection. The history of recent surgery and the presence of an open wound or surgical drain increases the risk of hospital acquired pneumonia. The child's recent admission also increases the likelihood of multi-drug resistant bacteria.

###Question: In an African region with limited access to advanced cardiac imaging, a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD). Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test?
###Options:
A. Coronary angiography
B. Cardiac CT angiography
C. Exercise stress test
D. Echocardiography
E. Myocardial perfusion imaging


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Exercise stress test. The initial diagnostic test of choice in this patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of CAD in an African region with limited access to advanced cardiac imaging is the exercise stress test. The exercise stress test is a non-invasive diagnostic test that is used to assess the functional capacity of the hea and to detect ischemic hea disease. It is a safe and effective method of diagnosing CAD. The exercise stress test is performed on a treadmill or a bicycle ergometer. The patient is made to walk or pedal on the machine until exhaustion. During the exercise, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is monitored and recorded. The exercise stress test is terminated if the patient develops symptoms or signs of ischemia or if the ECG changes are consistent with ischemia. The exercise stress test is considered positive if the patient develops ischemic ECG changes or develops symptoms of ischemia. The exercise stress test is considered negative if the patient does not develop ischemic ECG changes or symptoms despite performing the maximum exercise tolerance. The exercise stress test is considered equivocal if the ECG changes are not consistent with ischemia but the patient develops symptoms of ischemia. The exercise stress test is not indicated in patients with a history of cardiac transplantation, severe aortic stenosis, severe aortic insufficiency, severe left ventricular dysfunction, severe valvular hea disease, or severe pulmonary hypertension. The exercise stress test is indicated in patients with a history of cardiac surgery other than CABG, if the patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, if the patient has a history of pericardial disease, if the patient has a history of pulmonary disease, if the patient has a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or if the patient has a history of severe renal disease. The exercise stress test is not indicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, unless the patient has a history of carotid stenosis. The exercise stress test is indicated in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, if the patient has a history of thyroid disease, if the patient has a history of hyperparathyroidism, if the patient has a history of anemia, if the patient has a history of chronic liver disease, if the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if the patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, if the patient has a history of pulmonary disease, if the patient has a history of renal disease, if the patient has a history of severe renal disease, if the patient has a history of severe valvular hea disease, if the patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, or if the patient has a history of ventricular fibrillation. The exercise stress test is indicated in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, if the patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, if the patient has a history of coronary endarterectomy, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary angioplasty, if the patient has a history of coronary atherectomy, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent placement, if the patient has a history of coronary stent"

###Question: A 38-year-old, G2P0, Spanish-speaking woman at 36 weeks gestation is seen in the antepartum evaluation center with contractions and concerns that her water broke. Her nephew reports that roughly 20 years ago, while living in Nicaragua, she required an emergency cesarean section for unknown reasons. On examination, she appears in no acute distress. Her heart rate is 80/min, and her blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Tocometry reveals uterine contractions lasting 30 seconds. An abdominal sonogram reveals a fetus that is of appropriate size for gestational age and is in vertex position. Fetal heart tracing is reassuring. What is the best next step in management?
###Options:
A. Administer tocolysis
B. Augment with oxytocin
C. Cesarean section
D. Emergent cesarean section
E. Manage expectantly and anticipate spontaneous vaginal delivery


### Response: The correct answer is"," C: Cesarean section. This patient has a history of a previous cesarean section and currently has contractions and concerns that her water has broken. This scenario is consistent with a diagnosis of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). PPROM is a condition characterized by rupture of the fetal membranes before the onset of labor and before 37 weeks of gestation. The risk of perinatal infection is increased in women with PPROM, and therefore, the best next step in management is to perform a cesarean section.

###Question: A 35-year-old man presents with a one-month history of sore throat and eating difficulty. He says that he experiences severe pain when swallowing food and he has lost 6 kg in the last three months. On examination, there is a white patch on the base of the tongue and a mass is palpated on his neck. A biopsy shows dysplastic cells. Which of the following tests is most likely to be conducted to detect the etiology of this patient's condition?
###Options:
A. Ultrasonography
B. Positron emission tomography scan
C. Human papillomavirus testing
D. MRI
E. CT


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, human papillomavirus testing. This patient's symptoms of sore throat, eating difficulty, and weight loss, along with the presence of a white patch on the base of the tongue and a neck mass, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). OPSCC is a type of cancer that is strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV testing is therefore the most appropriate test to detect the etiology of this patient's condition.

HPV testing is a highly sensitive test that can detect the presence of HPV DNA in a sample. It is important to note that HPV testing is not specific for OPSCC and can detect HPV DNA in other tissues as well. However, in the context of a patient with symptoms suggestive of OPSCC, such as those described in the question, an HPV test is the most appropriate initial test to detect the etiology of the patient's condition.

Ultrasonography, positron emission tomography scan, MRI, and CT are all imaging modalities that can be used to detect oropharyngeal cancers. However, in the context of a patient with symptoms suggestive of OPSCC, an HPV test is the most appropriate initial test to detect the etiology of the patient's condition.

###Question:  A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after he sustained a cut on his hand while loading cargo at his job. He lives alone and takes most of his meals at a local restaurant. He eats mostly snack foods at the bar and fast food. He drinks four to six 12-oz beers daily and double that amount on weekends. He takes no medications. Physical examination shows a 3-cm laceration on the right hand that is bleeding steadily.

B. DUSN is a common casue of incorrectly diagnosed ""unilateral retinitis pigmentosa""
C. Eradication of the subretinal nematode often results in an intense inflammatory reaction
D. Visual loss typically continues after successful eardication of the subretinal nematode
E. The condition is seen only in individuals with a history of travel to endemic areas


### Response: The correct answer is"," option D: Visual loss typically continues after successful eradication of the subretinal nematode. Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN) DUSN is a condition that is characterized by the following: Chronic, slowly progressive visual loss. Visual field defects that are typically arcuate or paracentral scotomas. A characteristic funduscopic appearance consisting of multiple, small, round, white-centered retinal lesions that are arranged in a diffuse, salt-and-pepper-like distribution. The lesions are located in the posterior pole and retinal periphery. A history of travel to an area where DUSN is endemic is common. DUSN is caused by infection with the nematode Onchocerca volvulus, which is endemic in Africa, Central and South America, and the Middle East. The nematode is transmitted by the bite of a blackfly or buffalo gnat. The nematode is retained in the eye by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The RPE cells are the primary site of inflammation and damage. The nematode does not migrate within the eye. The inflammation and damage to the RPE cells result in a slowly progressive loss of vision. The inflammation and damage to the RPE cells also result in the leakage of lipofuscin and other cellular debris from the RPE cells into the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. This lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE is visible as the ""salt-and-pepper"" lesions on fundoscopy.

###Options:
A. Oral cephalexin
B. Griseofulvin
C. Hydrocortisone cream
D. Topical mupirocin ointment
E. Topical ketoconazole


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Hydrocortisone cream. The patient's presentation is suggestive of a fungal infection, most likely Tinea corporis, which is a dermatophyte infection of the skin. The scaling, serpiginous border, and annular shape are all characteristic of this infection. The treatment of choice for Tinea corporis is topical corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, which suppress the inflammatory response and promote healing. Oral azoles, such as fluconazole or itraconazole, are also effective treatments for Tinea corporis. However, these medications are often used for more severe or extensive infections. Oral terbinafine is also effective for the treatment of Tinea corporis, but it is not as commonly used as topical corticosteroids. Oral cephalexin is an antibiotic and would not be effective against a fungal infection. Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication that is no longer recommended for the treatment of Tinea corporis due to high rates of resistance. Topical mupirocin ointment is used to treat bacterial skin infections, not fungal infections.

###Options:
A. Metronidazole, ACE inhibitor
B. Contrast CT levofloxacin 10% dextrose
C. Contrast CT Ofloxacin Normal saline
D. Technitium 99 ofloxacin 
E. Doppler ultrasound Levofloxacin and Normal saline


### Response: The correct answer is"," option 2, contrast CT levofloxacin 10% dextrose. This patient is most likely suffering from a urinary tract infection (UTI) and the most common organism causing UTIs is E. coli. The patient's symptoms of left flank pain, increased frequency of urination, and burning sensation while urinating are classic symptoms of a UTI. The patient's fever could be due to the infection itself or a secondary infection. The patient's blood pressure of 120/90 is within normal range and is not a significant finding in this case.

The next step in management would be to obtain a urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity to determine the specific organism causing the infection and the appropriate antibiotic to use. The most common antibiotic used to treat UTIs is the fluoroquinolone antibiotic, such as levofloxacin. The antibiotic should be given orally and not by intravenous route because it is not effective by intravenous route. The antibiotic should be given for 7 to 14 days.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?
###Options:
A. Tuberculosis
B. Lung cancer
C. Histoplasmosis
D. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
E. None of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Tuberculosis. The patient's symptoms of chronic cough, fatigue, fever, and night sweats, along with the chest X-ray findings of a cavitary lesion in the lung, are all indicative of tuberculosis (TB). This is especially likely in a patient with a history of repeated pregnancies and a history of giving birth, as this increases her risk of developing TB. TB is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which primarily affects the lungs. It is transmitted through airborne droplets and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is more common in developing countries and in individuals with weakened immune systems. The symptoms of TB can vary greatly depending on the severity of the infection. Mild cases may present with chronic cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. More severe cases may present with symptoms such as hemoptysis (coughing up blood), shortness of breath, chest pain, and respiratory failure. The chest X-ray findings of cavitary lesions are highly suggestive of TB. Cavities are formed when TB bacteria break down and necrose, leading to the formation of a large, hollow, and destructive area in the lung.

### Response: The correct answer is"," B Tuberculosis of the Colon and Rectum (Ref: Harrison 17/e p1889, 1890; CMDT 2006 p569) The farmer in question has a combination of symptoms that could be suggestive of any of the following diagnoses: Ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease Amoebiasis with amoeboma Colorectal carcinoma Tuberculosis of the colon and rectum is a rare entity in the developed world but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhoea, weight loss and abdominal mass in the young and in the appropriate clinical setting. The clinical presentation of Tuberculosis of the Colon and Rectum is similar to that of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease. The presence of a mass in the left lower abdomen in a patient with chronic diarrhoea and weight loss is highly suggestive of malignancy. However, the mass in Tuberculosis of the Colon and Rectum is an amoeboma and not a malignant mass. The amoeboma is a granulomatous mass that is formed as a result of granulomatous inflammation due to the tuberculous infection. The mass is palpable and may be confused with malignancy. The mass is not associated with systemic symptoms of tuberculosis. The mass is usually located in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. The mass is not fixed to the overlying skin. The mass is not associated with systemic symptoms of tuberculosis. The mass is not associated with systemic symptoms of tuberculosis. The mass is not associated with systemic symptoms of tuberculosis.

B. Secondary hyperaldosetronism
C. Conn's syndrome
D. Renal artery stenosis
E. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, Conn's syndrome. This is a case of primary hyperaldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome. It is a condition where the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone, a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels in the blood. This leads to high blood pressure. The patient in the question stem has high blood pressure, which is a classic sign of Conn's syndrome. The patient should be referred to an endocrinologist for further investigation and treatment. Cushing's disease is characterized by excessive production of cortisol by the adrenal glands. This can lead to high blood pressure, but it is not the most common cause of high blood pressure in this age group. Secondary hyperaldosteronism is a condition where the body produces too much aldosterone due to another medical condition. This is usually caused by kidney damage. In this case, the patient's blood pressure is not as high as it would be in Conn's syndrome, and the patient would have other signs of secondary hyperaldosteronism such as low potassium levels. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a rare condition where the adrenal glands produce too much steroid hormones. This can lead to high blood pressure, but it is not the most common cause of high blood pressure in this age group.

###Options:
A. Lyme disease recurrence
B. Fibromyalgia
C. Systemic lupus erythematosus
D. arthritis
E. Still disease


### Response: The correct answer is"," B: Fibromyalgia. The patient has a constellation of symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia, including joint pain, tenderness at specific points, morning stiffness, and a history of Lyme disease. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain and tenderness at specific points. It is often associated with fatigue, sleep disturbances, and bowel or bladder dysfunction. The cause is unknown, but there is an association with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thyroiditis. There is no evidence of inflammation or joint involvement. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and can present with joint pain and stiffness, but it is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms given her history of doxycycline treatment. Systemic lupus erythematosus can present with joint pain, but it is more likely to involve multiple joints and be associated with morning stiffness, rash, and other systemic symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis can present with joint pain and stiffness, but it is more likely to involve multiple joints and be associated with morning stiffness, rash, and other systemic symptoms.

You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries. Answer with the best option directly, followed by the rationale for the selected option.

### Input:
###Question: A 16-year-old presents with an altered level of consciousness. Her mother says the girl took some lorazepam from the cabinet a few hours ago. The patient drank an 'unknown amount' of alcohol last night at a party. Her history is significant for major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. She takes sertraline, alprazolam and has regular cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. She has tried illicit drugs but stopped them a year ago. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol occasionally. Vital signs are blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate 58 bpm, respiratory rate 9 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 90% on 5 L O2. Her Glasgow coma score is 8. Her ABG off oxygen is PO2 78 mm Hg, CO2 is 50mm Hg and bicarbonate is 27 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
###Options:
A. Naloxone
B. Flumazenil
C. Intubation and mechanical ventilation
D. Nasogastric tube placement and activated charcoal
E. Pyridoxine


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. The patient's altered level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and hypoxemia are consistent with benzodiazepine toxicity. The treatment of benzodiazepine toxicity is with flumazenil, which is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. However, in this case, the patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with opioid toxicity. Opioid toxicity is treated with naloxone, which is an opioid receptor antagonist. The patient's altered level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and hypoxemia are consistent with opioid toxicity. The patient's history of major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety suggests she is a chronic user of benzodiazepines and opioids. The patient's low bicarbonate level is consistent with opioid toxicity, as opioids can cause metabolic acidosis. The patient's low pH suggests that her respiratory depression is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's low oxygen saturation on 5 L O2 suggests that her respiratory depression is severe enough to require supplemental oxygen. The patient's low pCO2 suggests that her respiratory depression is severe enough to cause respiratory acidosis.

You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries. Answer with the best option directly, followed by the rationale for the selected option.

### Input:
###Question: A 72-year-old male with type II diabetes, hypertension, and a history of recurrent pneumonia is admitted to the Medical intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of septic shock. His vital signs are: BP 80/60 mmHg, RR 24 breaths per minute, pulse 120 beats per minute (bpm), temp. 102.4°F,  O2 saturation 99% on room air. Of the choices listed below, what would be your initial management?
###Options:
A. Start IV dopamine
B. Start empiric IV broad spectrum antibiotics
C. Bolus IV fluids
D. Intubate and start ventilator support
E. Start IV norepinephine


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Intubate and start ventilator support. The patient's vital signs show a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, which is indicative of severe respiratory distress. The patient's oxygen saturation of 99% on room air is also concerning for impending respiratory failure. The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate are also concerning for cardiovascular instability. The patient's age and comorbidities also increase the severity of his condition.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with septic shock, a medical emergency requiring immediate management. Septic shock is characterized by a decrease in blood pressure despite an increase in cardiac output, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate are consistent with this definition.

The initial management of septic shock involves rapid resuscitation with intravenous fluids. The patient's blood pressure is significantly low, so the correct initial step would be to rapidly increase his blood volume with intravenous fluids. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is also low, indicating impending respiratory failure. In septic shock, the lungs can become ""stuck"" in a state of pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure. The patient's low oxygen saturation on room air is a concerning sign for impending respiratory failure. Therefore, the correct initial step would be to intubate the patient and start mechanical ventilation. This will ensure that the patient's oxygen saturation is maintained and will help improve his respiratory status.

The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate are consistent with septic shock. The patient's low blood pressure can be treated with intravenous fluids, but his elevated heart rate is more indicative of cardiovascular instability. In septic shock, the heart can become hyperdynamic due to the release of catecholamines and other stress hormones. The patient's elevated heart rate is a sign of this hyperdynamic state. The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate are consistent with septic shock, so the correct initial step would be to treat the patient's low blood pressure with intravenous fluids. The patient's elevated heart rate is a sign of septic shock, so the correct initial step would be to treat the patient's hyperdynamic state with intravenous beta blockers. The patient's age and comorbidities also increase the severity of his condition. The patient's age increases the risk of complications from septic shock, and his comorbidities increase the likelihood of mortality. The patient's age and comorbidities, along with his severe clinical presentation, all point to the need for immediate intervention.

The patient's respiratory status is also a concern. The patient's low oxygen saturation on room air and elevated respiratory rate are concerning for impending respiratory failure. The patient's low oxygen saturation on room air is also indicative of a low cardiac output state, which can lead to respiratory failure. The patient's elevated respiratory rate is also indicative of respiratory distress. The patient's low oxygen saturation and elevated respiratory rate, along with his severe clinical presentation, all point to the need for immediate intervention.

The patient's age and comorbidities also increase the severity of his condition. The patient's age increases the risk of complications from septic shock, and his comorbidities increase the likelihood of mortality. The patient's age and comorbidities, along with his severe clinical presentation, all point to the need for immediate intervention.

The patient's respiratory status is also a concern. The patient's low oxygen saturation on room air and elevated respiratory rate are concerning for respiratory distress. The patient's low oxygen saturation is indicative of a low cardiac output state, which can lead to respiratory distress. The patient's elevated respiratory rate is also indicative of respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory status, along with his severe clinical presentation, all point to the need for immediate intervention.

C. Hyperthyroidism
D. Polycystic ovary syndrome
E. Turner's syndrome


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Polycystic ovary syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity, and polycystic ovaries. The most common laboratory abnormalities are elevated LH and testosterone levels. Hypercholesterolemia and low HDL are also common. Hyperprolactinemia is unlikely in this case as prolactin levels are not elevated. Female athlete triad is unlikely as there is no history of exercise deprivation. Hyperthyroidism is unlikely as there is no history of weight loss or palpitations.

###Question: Which of the following diagnoses is most likely to explain the symptoms observed in a 4-year-old boy who, after visiting a local amusement park where several family members developed gastroenteritis, now presents with fever and diarrhea accompanied by bloody stool? Over the past 24 hours, he has developed pallor, lethargy, facial swelling, and decreased urination. Laboratory results show a hematocrit of 28% and a platelet count of 72,000/μL, along with blood and protein in the urine.
###Options:
A. Henoch-Schönlein purpura
B. IgA nephropathy
C. Intussusception
D. Meckel diverticulum
E. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. The clinical presentation of bloody diarrhea, pallor, lethargy, facial swelling, and decreased urination in a child with a hematocrit of 28% and a platelet count of 72,000/μL is highly suggestive of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is a disease characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. It is most commonly caused by infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), which can cause damage to the endothelium of blood vessels throughout the body. The bloody diarrhea and pallor seen in this patient are likely due to the release of endotoxins from the STEC into the systemic circulation, causing a systemic inflammatory response. The resulting microangiopathy leads to hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the subsequent renal failure is due to the damage of the glomerular endothelium and basement membrane.
The other choices are not likely to explain the symptoms observed in this patient. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (choice A) is a systemic vasculitis that typically affects children and is characterized by palpable purpura, arthralgias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and renal involvement. The symptoms of bloody diarrhea and renal failure are not typical of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. IgA nephropathy (choice B) is a condition characterized by the deposition of IgA immune complexes in the mesangium of the glomeruli, leading to glomerulonephritis. While it can cause hematuria and proteinuria, it is not typically associated with bloody diarrhea or renal failure. Intussusception (choice C) is a condition in which a portion of the intestine is telescoped into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction. It is more common in children and typically presents with intermittent abdominal pain, bloody stools, and passage of currant jelly stools. Meckel diverticulum (choice D) is a congenital abnormality in which a small pouch forms in the wall of the small intestine. It is typically asymptomatic but can present with bleeding or obstruction.

The symptoms observed in this patient, including bloody diarrhea, pallor, lethargy, facial swelling, and renal failure, are consistent with the diagnosis of HUS. The presence of bloody stools and proteinuria in a child with a decreased platelet count should raise suspicion for this condition. The prognosis of HUS is poor, with a high risk of renal failure and death. Prompt recognition and treatment with supportive care, including dialysis, are crucial to improving outcomes.

###Options:
A. Abdominal x-ray
B. Colonoscopy plus upper GI endoscopy
C. Colonoscopy
D. CT angiography

### Instruction:
You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries. Answer with the best option directly, followed by the rationale for the selected option.

### Input:
###Question: A 65-year-old man presents for a routine visit. He has a past medical history significant for osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He has an 80-pack-year smoking history and does not drink alcohol. His medications include quinapril and insulin. Physical examination reveals a 1x1.5 cm raised, ulcerated mass at the right base of his tongue. A biopsy identifies the mass as squamous cell carcinoma and the patient eventually undergoes surgical resection. Which of the following are potential complications of the surgery?
###Options:
A. Altered taste on anterior two-thirds of the tongue
B. Altered taste on posterior one-thirds of the tongue
C. Facial droop
D. Abnormal voice pitch
E. Decreased sensation of the jaw


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Altered taste on anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The patient's tongue is divided into three regions: anterior two-thirds, posterior one-third, and circumvallate papillae. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is responsible for taste sensation, and the posterior one-third is responsible for swallowing and speech. The surgical resection of the tumor on the right side of the tongue will likely result in altered taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This is because the taste buds on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue are located on the surface epithelium, whereas the taste buds on the posterior one-third of the tongue are located in the underlying lamina propria. The facial nerve is responsible for the innervation of the muscles of facial expression and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue receive sensory innervation from the lingual nerve. The mandibular branch of the facial nerve innervates the muscles of facial expression and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve innervates the muscles of tongue movement and the posterior one-third of the tongue. The internal laryngeal nerve innervates the muscles of the larynx and the posterior one-third of the tongue. The vagus nerve innervates the muscles of swallowing and the circumvallate papillae.

###Options:
A. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)
B. Prenatal screening using chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
C. Carrier screening for hemoglobinopathies
D. Genetic counseling for autosomal dominant disorders
E. Preconception counseling for chromosomal abnormalities


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Carrier screening for hemoglobinopathies. The prevalence of sickle cell disease in the population is high, so screening for the disease is warranted. Prenatal screening using CVS is not appropriate because it is an invasive procedure and is associated with a risk of miscarriage. PGD is an option, but it is not appropriate in this situation because the disease is autosomal recessive. Preconception counseling for chromosomal abnormalities is not indicated because the prevalence of autosomal dominant disorders in the population is low.

###Question: A 65-year-old man with mild hypertension comes to the veterans’ administration outpatient clinic because he is concerned about having an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He says he feels well. His medications are metoprolol and lisinopril. His older brother, who was ""seemingly in good health,"" recently underwent emergency repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm that had not been diagnosed previously. The patient retired from the military 15 years ago. He smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 20 years ago. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2. Pulse is 72/min and regular, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no organomegaly or tenderness to palpation. The aortic pulsation is estimated at 3 cm in width. A midepigastric bruit is heard. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
###Options:
A. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
B. Digital angiography of the aorta
C. Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen
D. X-ray of the abdomen
E. No diagnostic imaging is indicated


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

A. Failure of the kidneys to rotate 90 degrees medially
B. Failure of normal kidney ascent
C. Failure of one ureteric bud to develop normally
D. Fusion of the inferior poles of the metanephros during ascent
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Failure of the kidneys to rotate 90 degrees medially. This is the most likely embryologic origin of the patient's condition. The kidneys develop from two sources: The metanephros, which is the lower pole of the mesonephros, is the source of the excretory unit (nephron) of the kidney. The metanephros is located in the pelvis of the fetus and then ascends to its final position in the retroperitoneum. During this ascent, the ureteric buds arise from the lower poles of the metanephros and form the ureter. The metanephros and ureteric buds rotate 90 degrees medially during ascent. Failure of this rotation results in a U-shaped kidney.

###Question: A 23-year-old man with a chronic disease involving weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, gastrointestinal pain, and bloody diarrhea develops an unrelated infection requiring him to take amoxicillin-clavulanate. Which of the following is the most appropriate adjustment to the patient's dosage?
###Options:
A. Increasing the length of treatment
B. Decreasing the loading dose of medication
C. Increasing the maintenance dose of medication
D. Taking the medication with food
E. Taking the medication in excess


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Taking the medication in excess.

The patient's symptoms of iron deficiency anemia, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss are consistent with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, including iron, and increased intestinal bleeding.

The patient's chronic disease also requires treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, an antibiotic commonly used to treat infections of the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with IBD, the intestinal inflammation can lead to malabsorption of the medication, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Therefore, the most appropriate adjustment to the patient's dosage is to take the medication in excess. This will ensure that the patient takes a higher than normal dose of the antibiotic, which will still be effective in treating the infection, while minimizing the risk of exacerbating the patient's IBD symptoms.

D. Elevated fibrinogen level
E. Decreased D-dimer level


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, Prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT). DIC is characterized by a prolonged PT and/or a prothrombin ratio (PR) greater than 1.2. The PT and PR are prolonged because of the consumption of clotting factors caused by the formation of intravascular fibrin. The consumption of platelets and clotting factors leads to a decreased platelet count and fibrinogen level. The fibrinogen level is decreased because of consumption and degradation.

She denies any eye trauma or allergies and is not on any medications. She has no significant past medical history.  Her ocular examination reveals an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio. Intraocular pressure by tonometry is 26 mm Hg in both eyes. Which of the following medications is most appropriate?
###Options:
A. Alpha-blockers
B. Beta-blockers
C. Calcium channel blockers
D. Potassium channel blockers
E. steroids


### Response: The correct answer is"," option E: steroids. The patient's symptoms of decreased field of vision, haloes, and increased optic cup-to-disk ratio are suggestive of glaucoma. Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy that can cause irreversible damage to the optic nerve if left untreated. The first-line treatment for glaucoma is usually a topical antiglaucoma medication, such as a beta-blocker or a prostaglandin analogue. In this case, the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant immediate intervention with antiglaucoma medications. Therefore, the most appropriate initial treatment is a course of oral prednisone, which is a potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medication. Prednisone reduces the inflammation in the eye and helps to relieve the patient's symptoms. This medication is usually tapered over a period of weeks to months, depending on the severity of the patient's symptoms.

###Options:
A. Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells
B. Cytochemical analysis of bone marrow cells
C. Direct microscopy of bone marrow cells
D. Electron microscopy
E. Flow cytometry


### Response: The correct answer is"," option 3, direct microscopy of bone marrow cells. The presence of petechiae and ecchymosis suggests a coagulation disorder.

###Question: A 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw. He appears diaphoretic and is tachycardic. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6. Troponin levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
###Options:
A. Administer aspirin, oxygen, nitroglycerin, and morphine
B. Perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
C. Administer thrombolytic therapy
D. Admit for observation and repeat troponin measurement in 6 hours
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: Perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This patient's presentation is consistent with acute myocardial infarction (MI), and the ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6 are indicative of an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The patient's age and risk factors (hypertension) are also consistent with this diagnosis. The treatment of choice for acute MI is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. PCI allows for restoration of blood flow to the infarcted area of myocardium, preventing further damage and improving patient outcomes. Aspirin, nitroglycerin, morphine, and oxygen are all appropriate initial therapies for acute MI, but they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Thrombolytic therapy is used in the treatment of acute MI, but it is reserved for patients who present early (within 12 hours of symptom onset) and who have a large area of viable myocardium remaining. In this case, the patient's presentation is more consistent with an occlusion of the LAD, which has resulted in significant damage to the myocardium. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy would not be appropriate. The patient's age and risk factors (hypertension) also make thrombolytic therapy less suitable for this patient. The patient's presentation is more consistent with an occlusion of the LAD, which has resulted in significant damage to the myocardium. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy would not be appropriate. The patient's age and risk factors (hypertension) also make thrombolytic therapy less suitable for this patient.

Option A: Administer aspirin, oxygen, nitroglycerin, and morphine.
- This option addresses the patient's symptoms of chest pain, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the occlusion of the LAD. It does not address the need for reperfusion therapy to restore blood flow to the infarcted area of myocardium. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Option B: Perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- This option is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. The patient's presentation is consistent with acute myocardial infarction (MI), and the ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6 are indicative of an occlusion of the LAD. The patient's age and risk factors (hypertension) are also consistent with this diagnosis. The treatment of choice for acute MI is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. PCI allows for restoration of blood flow to the infarcted area of myocardium, preventing further damage and improving patient outcomes. Therefore, this option is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option C: Administer thrombolytic therapy.
- This option is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. The patient's presentation is more consistent with an occlusion of the LAD, which has resulted in significant damage to the myocardium. Thrombolytic therapy is typically reserved for patients who present early (within 12 hours of symptom onset) and who have a large area of viable myocardium remaining. In this case, the patient's age and risk factors (hypertension) make thrombolytic therapy less suitable.

Option D: Admit for observation and repeat troponin measurement in 6 hours.
- This option is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. The patient's presentation is consistent with acute MI, and the ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6 are indicative of an occlusion of the LAD. The patient's age and risk factors (hypertension) make observation and repeat troponin measurement in 6 hours a reasonable approach. This will allow for monitoring of troponin levels over time and assessment of the patient's response to treatment. It will help determine if the patient's symptoms are due to an acute coronary syndrome or a non-acute cause.

The patient gives a history of an upper respiratory infection that seemed to be resolving, but then he develops a cough with occasional posttussive emesis. The cough attack is so severe that he starts developing shortness of breath, generally occurring at night. It usually awakens him from sleep and is quite frightening. On physical examination, he looks fatigued and has a fever of 100.2 °F (37.9 °C) and sinus tachycardia (100 bpm), while his blood pressure is 145/92 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 97%. On auscultation, bilateral rhonchi were observed. Which of the following is the complication that can be fatal in this patient and is also the major cause of mortality in these patients?
###Options:
A. siezures
B. encephalopathy
C. Superimposed pneumonia
D. Malignant otitis media
E. atelactasis


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Superimposed pneumonia. This patient's symptoms of cough, posttussive emesis, fever, and fatigue are suggestive of a lower respiratory tract infection. The presence of rhonchi on auscultation of the lungs is also indicative of a lower respiratory tract infection. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a lower respiratory tract infection, which can progress to pneumonia if not treated promptly. The patient's symptoms of cough, posttussive emesis, and fever are concerning for a complication of pneumonia, which is the major cause of mortality in these patients.

Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can progress to a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly. Pneumonia can be classified as either community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). CAP is pneumonia that develops outside of a healthcare setting, while HAP is pneumonia that develops in a healthcare setting. The risk factors for pneumonia include advanced age, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, alcoholism, malnutrition, and immunocompromised state.

The patient's symptoms of cough, posttussive emesis, and fever are concerning for a complication of pneumonia, which is the major cause of mortality in these patients.

The most common complications of pneumonia are respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. Respiratory failure occurs when the body's ability to provide oxygen to cells is compromised. Sepsis is a systemic response to infection that can lead to organ failure. Multiorgan failure occurs when there is failure of multiple organs, such as the lungs, kidneys, and liver.

### Input:
###Question: A 17-year-old is involved in a house fire and brought to the hospital in a coma. He is resuscitated and sent to the intensive care unit. He is orally intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Respiration rate is 16 breaths/min on mechanical ventilation. Oxygen saturation is 100% on 25% of oxygen. He is not triggering the ventilator. Two days later, he is extubated. He is receiving intravenous fluids, and his current medications include prophylactic antibiotics. He eats mostly junk food and has no allergies. The next day, he develops guaiac-positive stools, and his hemoglobin is found to be 8 g/dL. Which of the following is related to the cause of this patient’s problem?
###Options:
A. Colon outpouring
B. Gastrointestinal ulcer
C. Excessive fluid administration
D. Excess Helicobacter pylori
E. Diverticulosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B, Gastrointestinal ulcer.

The patient's presentation of guaiac-positive stools and low hemoglobin suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This bleeding is likely related to his recent extubation, as he is not triggering the ventilator and has no history of trauma or other significant events that would cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by gastric or duodenal ulcers, which are common in patients who have been recently extubated. These ulcers can cause bleeding that can lead to anemia and guaiac-positive stools.

Gastric ulcers are more common in the stomach, while duodenal ulcers are more common in the duodenum. Both can be caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a common cause of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.

The excessive fluid administration mentioned in Option C is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's problem. Fluid overload can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress, but it would not cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding or anemia.

Options A, D, and E are not related to the patient's presentation. Option A, colon outpouching, is a condition known as a pouch, and it is not related to the patient's symptoms. Option E, diverticulosis, is a condition characterized by small sacs or pouches in the colon, and it is not related to the patient's symptoms. Option D, excessive Helicobacter pylori, is mentioned as a possible cause of the patient's problem, but it is not the most likely cause.

### Input:
###Question: A 63-year-old man presents because of unusual dizziness and weakness. The patient's regular medications include finasteride, propanolol, and atorvastatin. He has had an unusually low sex drive with his wife and is having difficulty ejaculating. He has noticed there is minimal ejaculate compared to normal. He has atherosclerosis, hypertension, and benign hyperplasia of the prostate. He has recently been prescribed fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests are pending. Which of the following is the cause of the patient's decreased ejaculate volume?
###Options:
A. Interactions with finasteride and fluconazole via CYP3A4
B. Inhibiting the production of 5-alpha-reductase
C. Worsening benign hyperplasia of the prostate
D. Interactions with propranolol and fluconazole
E. None


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Interactions with finasteride and fluconazole via CYP3A4. Fluconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and finasteride is a moderate inhibitor. Both of these medications are metabolized by CYP3A4. When fluconazole is administered to a patient taking finasteride, the concentration of finasteride in the blood increases. This is because fluconazole competitively inhibits CYP3A4, which normally metabolizes finasteride. The same is true for propranolol and finasteride. Propranolol is also metabolized by CYP3A4, and when fluconazole is administered to a patient taking propranolol, the concentration of propranolol in the blood increases. This is because fluconazole competitively inhibits CYP3A4, which normally metabolizes propranolol. Both of these medications are substrates for CYP3A4. The increased concentration of these medications can lead to drug-drug interactions. The patient's unusual symptoms are likely due to these interactions.

###Question: A women is worried because she has been taking “body-building steroids” through week 10 of her pregnancy. One of the steroids has a strong proportion of androgens. You explain that androgens can cause which of the following?
###Options:
A. (A)	paramesonephros to differentiate into the proximal urinary duct system
B. (B)	Wolffian ducts to develop
C. (C)	Müllerian ducts to regress
D. (D)	the primitive vaginal tube to regress
E. (E)	the gonadal ridge to differentiate into a testis


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. The presence of androgens in the fetal environment inhibits the development of the Müllerian ducts, causing them to regress. This is why females have only a uterus and upper vagina. The Wolffian ducts develop into the male reproductive system. The paramesonephric ducts develop into the female reproductive system, including the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina. The primitive vaginal tube is a precursor to the vagina. The gonadal ridge develops into the testes.

###Question: An 18-month-old male is brought to the healthcare provider with recent-onset stridor. The parents report low-grade fever for the last three days. He also refuses to eat to drink milk and has no appetite. Fever is recorded as 100 F, blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg, and the pulse is 100/min. On chest examination, there is inspiratory stridor. He is bottle-fed and has had many missed vaccination appointments in the past. He was born in the hospital via C-section and had normal development after birth. A complete blood count is ordered and shows leucocytosis. A lateral neck x-ray reveals a characteristic cherry-shaped swelling. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Croup
B. Epiglottitis
C. Tonsillitis
D. Foreign body obstruction
E. pharygitis


### Response: The correct answer is"," B. Epiglottitis. This is a case of acute epiglottitis, which is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. The patient's age, low-grade fever, inspiratory stridor, leucocytosis, and characteristic x-ray findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. Acute epiglottitis is most commonly seen in children between the ages of two and six, and is rare in infants. It is most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib). Patients present with low-grade fever, sore throat, dysphagia, and drooling. On examination, the child is often in respiratory distress with inspiratory stridor. Lateral neck x-ray is diagnostic, showing a characteristic cherry-shaped swelling of the epiglottis. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and emergency airway management if the patient is in respiratory distress.

###Options:
A. Intravenous antihypertensive agents
B. Observation and regular blood pressure monitoring
C. Oral antihypertensive agents
D. Lifestyle modifications
E. Immediate hospital admission


### Response: The correct answer is"," Observation and regular blood pressure monitoring. The patient in question is presenting with hypertensive urgency, which is defined as a blood pressure reading of 160/100 mmHg or higher with symptoms of headache, dizziness, or visual disturbances. The initial management for this patient would be observation and regular blood pressure monitoring to determine if the patient's symptoms are resolving. This is to ensure that the patient does not have a stroke or myocardial infarction. Intravenous antihypertensive agents would not be the most appropriate initial management. Oral antihypertensive agents would not be the most appropriate initial management either, as the patient is presenting with hypertensive urgency, which requires immediate intervention. Lifestyle modifications would not be the most appropriate initial management either, as the patient is presenting with hypertensive urgency, which requires immediate intervention.

###Question: A 68-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department with a 5-day history of shortness of breath. He describes being jarred in an elevator 5 days earlier and sustaining a large bruise on his right flank. That evening, he had trouble sleeping from the pain, but finally managed to rest while sitting in a recliner. Over the past 5 days he has had progressive shortness of breath; originally it was related to exertion, but it now occurs at rest. He continues to sleep in the recliner for comfort. He does not smoke. On physical examination, an ecchymosis is evident on his right flank. He is mildly dyspneic with conversation. BMI is 25.7. Temperature is 38.3 °C (100.9 °F), pulse rate is 112/min, respiration rate is 26/min, and blood pressure is 142/72 mm Hg bilaterally. Pulse oximetry is 93% on room air. The trachea is midline, and jugular venous pressure is 6 cm. Lungs are dull to percussion, and there are decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest. Cardiovascular point of maximal impulse is at the fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line. He has tachycardia. No rubs, murmurs, or gallops are heard, and there is no evidence of edema. The electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia without acute ST- or T-wave changes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Pneumonia
B. Pulmonary Embolism
C. Hemothorax
D. Pleural effusion
E. Chylothorax


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Hemothorax. This patient's history of trauma, large bruise, and sudden onset of shortness of breath, along with decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the right side of the chest, is highly suggestive of a hemothorax. Hemothorax occurs when blood accumulates in the pleural space, leading to a buildup of pressure within the pleural cavity. This can occur from trauma, as in this case, or from rupture of a blood vessel or tumor. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pain from the hemothorax, and the trachea being midline suggests that the hemothorax is not massive enough to shift the trachea to the opposite side. The differential for a hemothorax includes pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and chylothorax, but these conditions would not explain the patient's history of trauma, bruise, and sudden onset of symptoms.

###Question: You are seeing a 26-year-old woman who is complaining of “skipping heartbeats.” She uses caffeine daily, but denies using other drugs. The rest of her history is completely normal, as is her physical examination. In the office, her 12-lead ECG is also normal. Her electrolytes and CBC comes back normal, as does her thyroid stimulating hormone. Which of the following is the next step in her workup?
###Options:
A. Reassure her and continue observation
B. Perform ambulatory ECG monitoring (a 24 Holter monitor or a continuous loop event recorder.)
C. Electrophysiology consultation
D. stress testing
E. echocardiography


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: Perform ambulatory ECG monitoring (a 24 Holter monitor or a continuous loop event recorder.) This patient is experiencing ""skipping heartbeats"" or ""dropped beats,"" which is a common symptom of both benign and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. The fact that her physical examination and ECG are normal makes it less likely that she has a serious arrhythmia. However, since she is experiencing these symptoms, it is important to rule out a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The best way to do this is to have her wear a Holter monitor or a continuous loop event recorder for 24-48 hours. This monitor will record her ECG continuously and will help identify any episodes of asymptomatic, self-terminating, or symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter. If these arrhythmias are confirmed, then further evaluation with an electrophysiology consultation and possibly a cardiac stress test or echocardiogram may be indicated. However, since her physical examination and ECG are normal, this is less likely to be the case. Therefore, the best next step is to perform ambulatory ECG monitoring.

###Question: A 30-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a fever of 102 F after chemotherapy induction that developed two days ago. Blood cultures, basic metabolic profiles, and complete blood counts have been collected. The absolute neutrophil count is calculated to be 400 cells/mm3. Which of the following steps is likely to provide the highest mortality benefit for this patient?
###Options:
A. A 30-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a fever of 102 F after chemotherapy induction that developed two days ago. Blood cultures, basic metabolic profiles, and complete blood counts have been collected. The absolute neutrophil count is calculated to be 400 cells/mm3. Which of the following steps is likely to provide the highest mortality benefit for this patient?
B. Start intravenous monotherapy with cefepime
C. Start oral monotherapy
D. Start voriconazole
E. start rituximab


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: Start intravenous monotherapy with cefepime. This patient has febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency. The patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 400 cells/mm3, which is significantly lower than the normal range. This indicates a very low neutrophil count, which puts the patient at high risk for developing an infection that can be life-threatening. Febrile neutropenia is a medical emergency because the neutrophils are responsible for the body's first line of defense against bacterial infections. Without an adequate number of neutrophils, the body cannot effectively combat the bacteria, leading to a high risk of developing a bacterial infection.

The patient's fever of 102 F is also concerning. Fever is a sign of infection, and a patient with febrile neutropenia is at a higher risk of developing a bacterial infection. Therefore, starting intravenous monotherapy with cefepime is the most appropriate step because it provides the highest mortality benefit for this patient. Cefepime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers a wide range of bacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, anaerobes, and some fungi. It is effective against many common pathogens that can cause infections in patients with febrile neutropenia.

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of various lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. It is not the most appropriate treatment for febrile neutropenia. Rituximab does not directly target bacteria and does not provide the highest mortality benefit for patients with febrile neutropenia.

Option C, oral monotherapy, is not the best choice for this patient. Oral monotherapy is not recommended in patients with febrile neutropenia because it can lead to treatment failure due to the inability of the patient to absorb the antibiotic properly. The low neutrophil count in this patient makes it difficult for the body to absorb the antibiotic, leading to suboptimal treatment. Therefore, oral monotherapy is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient.

Option D, start oral monotherapy with voriconazole, is not the best choice for this patient. Voriconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections. However, in patients with febrile neutropenia, the primary concern is the risk of developing a bacterial infection, not a fungal infection. Therefore, starting oral monotherapy with voriconazole is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient.

###Question: A 65-year-old man presents with intense abdominal pain, nausea, and 2 episodes of emesis, which started 2 hours ago. He was having dinner at a nearby restaurant and suddenly felt intense pain. He has never had this type of pain before, although he does report having periodic abdominal pain for several months. His medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. He denies the use of alcohol or any illicit drugs. He has no allergies. His vital signs are heart rate 120 bpm, blood pressure 100/80 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula. A physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal pain with rebound and guarding. Which of the following pathologies can present with such findings?
###Options:
A. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
B. Boerhaave's syndrome
C. Peptic ulcer
D. Chronic pancreatitis
E. Liver disease


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Peptic ulcer disease (PUD), which is characterized by severe abdominal pain that is often located in the epigastric region. The pain is usually described as burning or stabbing and is often associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and bloating. The pain is usually worse after eating and is relieved by taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PUD is a common condition that affects approximately 10% of the adult population in the United States. It is caused by the presence of gastric or duodenal ulcers, which can be caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, NSAID use, or excessive alcohol consumption.

###Question: A 70-year-old man is brought to the hospital with confusion. He is widowed and stays alone at home but can perform day-to-day activities independently. His kids visit him once a week or so. He had an intermittent low-grade fever for the past week, for which his primary care provider had prescribed acetaminophen tablets. His neighbor noticed subtle behavioral changes in the past week. Grandchildren who visited him today found him confused, abusive, and aggressive. They also noticed that he had passed urine and stools in the living room. CT of the brain is unremarkable. A urine toxicology screen is negative. CSF study shows RBCs 150 microL, WBCs 300/mmicroL (90% lymphocytes). The protein is 136 mg/dL and glucose 50 mg/dL (corresponding blood glucose is 85 mg/dL). The remaining CSF reports are awaited. Which of the following evaluations is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis in this patient?
###Options:
A. Brain biopsy
B. MRI brain with diffusion-weighted images and FLAIR sequences
C. Clinical symptoms and signs
D. CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
E. CT brain


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B MRI brain with diffusion-weighted images and FLAIR sequences. This patient's clinical presentation, including confusion, low-grade fever, behavioral changes, urinary incontinence, and abnormal CSF findings (RBCs, elevated protein, low glucose), is highly suggestive of meningitis. The most common cause of meningitis in adults is bacterial, and the most common pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Escherichia coli. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is typically confirmed by a positive CSF Gram stain or culture. However, in this case, the patient's clinical presentation and CSF findings are highly suggestive of bacterial meningitis, and the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis is an MRI of the brain with diffusion-weighted images and FLAIR sequences. This imaging modality can reveal subtle changes in the meninges, basal cisterns, and brain parenchyma, which are characteristic of bacterial meningitis. These changes include restricted diffusion, increased signal intensity on FLAIR images, and enhancement of the meninges and brain.

###Question: A young Igbo business man brought in his 65-year-old father from the village. He presents with having to strain to pass urine, a thin stream, incomplete emptying, and a feeling of lower abdominal fullness for the preceding few weeks. He also reports some weight loss. His vital signs are all normal. Laboratory tests show a serum creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his renal failure?
###Options:
A. renal
B. prerenal
C. Post-renal, due to low-pressure chronic retention.
D. Post-renal, due to the development of chronic high-pressure retention.
E. none


### Response: The correct answer is"," post-renal, due to low-pressure chronic retention. This is a typical presentation of BPH. The patient has lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to bladder outlet obstruction. The obstruction is low-pressure chronic retention. The patient has a thin stream, incomplete emptying, and a feeling of lower abdominal fullness. The urine analysis shows pyuria, which is a sign of infection. The patient has recurrent UTIs. The infection is likely to spread to the kidneys, leading to renal failure. The patient also has a serum creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL, which is consistent with chronic kidney disease. The weight loss is likely due to the infection and renal damage. The other options are less likely causes of renal failure. Prerenal azotemia would present with a rise in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Post-renal azotemia would present with a rise in BUN levels only.

###Question: Which of the following is a risk factor for the development of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females?
###Options:
A. Prostate enlargement
B. Low estrogen levels
C. High urinary pH
D. History of kidney stones
E. Regular voiding


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B, low estrogen levels. Low estrogen levels are a risk factor for the development of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females. This is because urinary tract infections are more common in women during pregnancy, when estrogen levels are low. During pregnancy, the urethra is compressed against the pubic symphysis, which can cause urinary stasis and increase the risk of infection. Other risk factors for UTIs in females include a history of UTIs, a history of kidney stones, and a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Prostate enlargement is not a risk factor for UTIs in males or females. A high urinary pH is a risk factor for UTIs in males, not females. Regular voiding is a protective factor against UTIs. Regular voiding flushes out any bacteria that are present in the urinary tract and prevents them from forming a biofilm and causing an infection. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 48. Urinary Tract.

Oxytocin causes contraction of the myoepithelial cells that line the ducts of the mammary glands, thus propelling milk into the large ducts and, eventually, into the nipple. Oxytocin also causes contraction of the uterus during and after paurition, and it may play a role in the initiation of labour. Oxytocin is a peptide of nine amino acids that is identical in all species. Its gene is located on the X chromosome in humans and is expressed in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus."" - Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 23rd edition pg 320

###Question: A 17-year-old woman presents with increasing fatigue and palpitations. She has been feeling this way for the past six months and says these problems are affecting her quality of life. Echocardiography and ECG are normal except for sinus tachycardia. Basic labs show hemoglobin of 9 g/dl, a red blood cell distribution width (RDW) of 18 micrometers, and MCV 65 fL with an RBC count of 3.8 million cells/mcL. Her iron panel shows body iron at 4 g/dL and TIBC of 65 mcg/dL. What would likely explain the cause of her low hemoglobin levels?
###Options:
A. Increased green leafy vegetable intake over the last six months
B. decreased green leafy vegetable intake over the last six months
C. Decreased intrinsic factor
D. Increase menstrual flow over the past six months
E. Autoimmune disease of the bone marrow


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Decreased intrinsic factor. The patient's iron panel shows body iron at 4 g/dL and TIBC of 65 mcg/dL. This indicates a functional iron deficiency. The patient's low hemoglobin levels can be explained by a functional iron deficiency. The body needs iron for the synthesis of hemoglobin. If there is a functional iron deficiency, the body will not be able to make enough hemoglobin. This will lead to microcytic anemia. The patient's RDW of 18 micrometers indicates macrocytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia is commonly caused by a functional iron deficiency. The body needs iron for the synthesis of intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. If there is a functional iron deficiency, the body will not be able to make enough intrinsic factor. This will lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency will cause a megaloblastic anemia. The patient's low hemoglobin levels, microcytic anemia, and elevated RDW all point to a functional iron deficiency. The patient's normal ECG and echocardiography suggest that her symptoms are not due to a cardiac or structural abnormality. The patient's symptoms are most likely due to a functional iron deficiency anemia. Functional iron deficiency anemia is commonly seen in young women due to a combination of factors, including a vegetarian diet, excessive menstrual bleeding, and a low intake of iron supplements. Vegetarian diets can lead to a functional iron deficiency due to the inability of plants to absorb iron. Iron is absorbed in the duodenum by binding to intrinsic factor, which is produced by the parietal cells of the stomach. Vegetarian diets do not contain enough animal products to produce intrinsic factor, so iron absorption is impaired. Additionally, young women may have menorrhagia, which can lead to a functional iron deficiency. Menorrhagia is heavy menstrual bleeding, which can lead to iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss. Lastly, the patient's low intake of iron supplements may also contribute to her functional iron deficiency. Iron supplements are necessary to replenish the iron lost through heavy menstrual bleeding and to replace any lost iron due to gastrointestinal losses. The patient's low hemoglobin levels, microcytic anemia, and elevated RDW are consistent with a functional iron deficiency. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and palpitations are likely due to her low hemoglobin levels. The patient's low hemoglobin levels cause a functional iron deficiency, which leads to a megaloblastic anemia. A megaloblastic anemia is characterized by the presence of macrocytes on peripheral blood smear. The patient's macrocytic anemia is likely due to the body's inability to utilize the available iron, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and the formation of macrocytes. The patient's low hemoglobin levels and macrocytic anemia are consistent with a functional iron deficiency. The patient's vegetarian diet and low iron supplementation are likely contributing factors to her functional iron deficiency. Vegetarian diets do not contain enough animal products to replenish iron lost through heavy menstrual bleeding. Additionally, the patient's low hemoglobin levels and macrocytic anemia are consistent with a functional iron deficiency. The patient's low hemoglobin levels and macrocytic anemia are most likely due to a functional iron deficiency. The patient's vegetarian diet and low iron supplementation are likely contributing factors to her functional iron deficiency. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and palpitations are likely due to her low hemoglobin levels and macrocytic anemia. The patient's low hemoglobin levels and macrocytic anemia are most likely due to a functional iron deficiency. The patient's vegetarian diet and low iron supplementation are likely contributing factors to her functional iron deficiency.

###Question: What is the best diagnostic approach at this time for a 68-year-old man who complains of several blisters arising over the back and trunk for the preceding 2 weeks, without noted systemic symptoms such as fever, sore throat, weight loss, or fatigue? Physical examination reveals several 2 to 3 cm bullae over the trunk and back, with a few excoriations where the blisters have ruptured, while the remainder of the skin is normal, without erythema or scale.
###Options:
A. Culture of vesicular fluid for herpes viruses
B. CT scan of the chest and abdomen looking for occult malignancy
C. Combination of oral H1 and H2 antihistamines
D. Trial of corticosteroids
E. Biopsy of the edge of a bulla with some surrounding intact skin


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B CT scan of the chest and abdomen looking for occult malignancy. This patient's presentation is consistent with bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease. The most common trigger for bullous pemphigoid is thought to be an occult malignancy, most often a hematologic malignancy. The blisters are typically tense, and rupture leads to a moist, erythematous, and excoriated surface. The blisters are typically found on the trunk and limbs, sparing the face and oral mucosa. The disease is more common in the elderly, and the mortality rate is higher in this population. The diagnosis is confirmed by a biopsy of the edge of a bulla with some surrounding intact skin. The other options are less likely to be the correct answer. Option A, Culture of vesicular fluid for herpes viruses, is unlikely to be helpful because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with bullous pemphigoid rather than herpes virus infection. Option C, Combination of oral H1 and H2 antihistamines, is not the treatment of choice for bullous pemphigoid. It is used to control pruritus and limit secondary infection, but the mainstay of treatment is systemic corticosteroids. Option D, Trial of corticosteroids, is the correct treatment for bullous pemphigoid. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for bullous pemphigoid, and they are usually started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. They are effective in controlling the inflammation and blistering, but they also have significant side effects. Therefore, a trial of corticosteroids is the correct approach to determine if they are beneficial to the patient's symptoms.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
B. Neuromyelitis optica
C. Spinal cord tumor
D. Multiple sclerosis
E. HIV-associated myelopathy


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Neuromyelitis Optica. The patient's clinical presentation of progressive weakness, numbness, and difficulty walking, along with increased protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggests an inflammatory process affecting the spinal cord and optic nerves. The presence of a positive Babinski sign indicates lower motor neuron involvement. The most likely diagnosis is neuromyelitis optica (NMO), which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. The presence of anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies in the serum supports the diagnosis of NMO.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) typically presents with progressive weakness and muscle wasting, but without sensory symptoms. Spinal cord tumors can cause weakness and sensory symptoms, but they are usually associated with other neurological deficits. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause weakness and sensory symptoms, but it is typically associated with other neurological deficits.

###Options:
A. Stroke
B. Liver cirrhosis
C. Aplastic anemia
D. Pulmonary embolism
E. Renal failure


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Pulmonary embolism. The patient's presentation is suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis (HS), an autosomal dominant condition characterized by anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and hemolysis. The low levels of enzymes in red cells (e.g., G6PD, pyruvate kinase, etc.) lead to the production of abnormal red cells that are prone to hemolysis. The hemolysis leads to the release of free hemoglobin, which binds to plasma proteins, including haptoglobin. In the setting of HS, the abnormal red cells are not able to bind to haptoglobin, leading to hemoglobinuria. The hemolysis also leads to the production of bilirubin, which is then excreted by the liver, leading to jaundice. The anemia leads to compensatory mechanisms, such as splenomegaly, which can lead to complications such as portal hypertension and the risk of pulmonary embolism.

###Question: A 39-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 3, with a history of 2 prior cesarean deliveries, is undergoing an induction of labor with mechanical cervical dilation with oxytocin for prelabor rupture of membranes at 38 weeks of gestational age. An epidural is placed and functions well. The patient suddenly develops severe abdominal pain, which she describes to her nurse as a tearing sensation. External maternal-fetal monitoring, which has been Category I, shows a sudden drop in the fetal heart rate to 50 bpm. The maternal heart rate jumps to 130 bpm and her blood pressure is now 90/50 mm Hg. The patient is brought to the operating room for an emergent cesarean birth. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this event?
###Options:
A. Mechanical cervical dilation with oxytocin administration
B. Multiparity
C. Trial of labor after cesarean birth
D. Advanced maternal age
E. Blood pressure


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Mechanical cervical dilation with oxytocin administration. This case illustrates a rare but serious complication of induction of labor with oxytocin. Induction of labor is a common procedure in obstetrics, and oxytocin is often used for augmentation of labor. While oxytocin is a safe drug, it can cause severe maternal tachycardia and hypertension, which can lead to uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal distress. In this case, the patient's sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, fetal bradycardia, and subsequent fetal tachycardia and hypotension are all consistent with uteroplacental insufficiency secondary to oxytocin administration.

### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast. This patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence, blurred vision, and intermittent diplopia are suggestive of a neurologic disorder. The presence of blurred vision on one side and intermittent diplopia is highly suggestive of lateral rectus palsy, which is commonly associated with a neoplasm or inflammation in the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinuses contain the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve, the abducens nerve, the pituitary gland, and the internal carotid aery. Neoplasms in this area can cause compression of the abducens nerve, leading to the symptoms described in the patient. The next step in management would be to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast to evaluate for the presence of a cavernous sinus neoplasm.

She does not have any significant past medical history. Vital signs are temperature 37° C (98.6° F), heart rate 70 bpm, and respiratory rate 14 breaths/min. Her physical examination demonstrates normal findings. A pregnancy test is negative. An MRI of the brain and serology are ordered. Which of the following lab abnormalities would be expected?
###Options:
A. Increased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), decreased luteinizing hormone (LH)
B. Decreased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), decreased luteinizing hormone (LH)
C. Decreased prolactin, increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), increased luteinizing hormone (LH)
D. Increased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), increased luteinizing hormone (LH)
E. none


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Increased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), decreased luteinizing hormone (LH)

The patient's symptoms of bilateral breast milk discharge, intermittent headaches, and decreased libido are suggestive of a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma. This is a hormone producing tumor that leads to an increase in prolactin levels. Prolactin is responsible for milk production and inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Therefore, in a patient with a prolactin-secreting tumor, FSH and LH levels would be decreased, leading to amenorrhea and infertility.

###Question: What would be the most appropriate intraoperative course of action in a 54-year-old woman who undergoes a laparotomy due to a pelvic mass, wherein a unilateral ovarian neoplasm is discovered alongside a large omental metastasis, and a frozen section diagnosis confirms metastatic serous cystadenocarcinoma?
###Options:
A. Omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
B. Excision of the omental metastasis and ovarian cystectomy
C. Omentectomy and ovarian cystectomy
D. Excision of the omental metastasis and unilateral oophorectomy
E. Omentectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

The patient is presenting with a stage IIIC ovarian cancer, which is defined as a malignant ovarian neoplasm that has spread to the omentum and/or retroperitoneum. In this case, the patient has a unilateral ovarian neoplasm alongside a large omental metastasis, which is indicative of stage IIIC disease. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to perform a complete surgical staging procedure, which includes omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

The patient's age and comorbidities should not preclude the need for optimal surgical management. The patient's age alone does not preclude the need for complete surgical staging, as the patient is already at an advanced stage of the disease. The patient's comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, can be managed and controlled with proper preoperative optimization.

The patient should undergo complete surgical staging to determine the extent of the disease, as well as to perform cytoreductive surgery to reduce the tumor burden and improve the patient's prognosis. The surgical staging should include omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This will allow for the removal of the primary ovarian tumor, as well as the omental metastasis, which is the most common site of ovarian cancer metastasis.

The patient should also undergo cytoreductive surgery to reduce the tumor burden and improve the patient's prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery refers to the removal of all visible tumors, which helps reduce the tumor burden and improve prognosis. In this case, the patient has a large omental metastasis, which is a visible tumor. Therefore, cytoreductive surgery is indicated to reduce the tumor burden and improve the patient's prognosis.

The patient should not undergo unilateral oophorectomy, as this would not address the omental metastasis, which is the primary site of disease. The patient's unilateral ovarian neoplasm is likely a metastasis from the omental metastasis, and removing the ovarian neoplasm alone would not address the underlying omental metastasis.

The patient should not undergo unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as this would not address the omental metastasis, which is the primary site of disease. The patient's unilateral ovarian neoplasm is likely a metastasis from the omental metastasis, and removing the ovarian neoplasm alone would not address the underlying omental metastasis.

The patient should not undergo unilateral hysterectomy, as this would not address the omental metastasis, which is the primary site of disease. The patient's unilateral ovarian neoplasm is likely a metastasis from the omental metastasis, and removing the ovarian neoplasm alone would not address the underlying omental metastasis.

The patient should not undergo unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as this would not address the omental metastasis, which is the primary site of disease.

###Options:
A. Peripheral blood smear showing spherocytes
B. Bone marrow biopsy showing ringed sideroblasts
C. Heinz bodies within RBCs and bite cells
D. Peripheral blood smear showing microcytic RBCs with target cells
E. Bone marrow biopsy showing round sideroblasts


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Peripheral blood smear showing spherocytes. The given clinical history and laboratory findings are suggestive of spherocytosis. Spherocytosis is a condition characterized by the presence of spherical-shaped red blood cells (RBCs) with a central pallor and a peripheral rim of hemoglobin. The peripheral blood smear of a patient with spherocytosis typically shows the presence of spherocytes. These are RBCs that are shaped like a sphere, with a central pallor and a peripheral rim of hemoglobin. The presence of spherocytes can be seen in a variety of conditions, including hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and thalassemia.

Ringed sideroblasts are a finding seen in iron deficiency anemia, not in thalassemia. Option C: Heinz bodies within RBCs and bite cells are not likely to be found in this patient. Heinz bodies are formed when there is an abnormality in the synthesis of hemoglobin, and bite cells are seen in G6PD deficiency. Option D: Peripheral blood smear showing microcytic RBCs with target cells is not likely to be found in this patient.

###Options:
A. Simultaneous bilateral facial palsy
B. Recovery of facial nerve function that occurs 3 weeks after the facial palsy
C. Facial palsy occuring in a patient older than 50 years of age
D. Upper and lower facial musculature equally affected
E. all of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, Facial palsy occuring in a patient older than 50 years of age. The most common cause of facial palsy is Bell's palsy, which is idiopathic in nature. The onset of Bell's palsy is usually sudden, with most patients experiencing weakness within 24 hours of symptom onset. The majority of patients recover within 3 weeks. The overall prognosis for complete recovery of facial function is excellent. However, the prognosis for complete recovery of normal facial symmetry is poor in patients older than 50 years of age.

###Question: A 65-year-old woman presents with painful discoloration of her fingers. A history of present illness reveals that she has had similar episodes several times in the past 2 weeks. She says her fingers turn white, followed by redness on warming her hands. Her medical history includes systemic lupus erythematosus. On physical examination, the capillary refill time is 6 seconds, and blanching of the fingers results in cyanosis followed by erythema. Which of the following has the patient developed?
###Options:
A. Occlusive peripheral vascular disease
B. Primary Raynaud phenomenon
C. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon
D. Peripheral neuropathy
E. septicemia


### Response: The correct answer is"," B: Primary Raynaud phenomenon. Primary Raynaud phenomenon is the most common form of Raynaud phenomenon. It is idiopathic and occurs in younger patients. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is associated with an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Occlusive peripheral vascular disease is unlikely to cause Raynaud phenomenon. Peripheral neuropathy and septicemia do not cause Raynaud phenomenon.

###Question: 84yr old lady attends cardiology clinic for follow up of her recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation. She is on rate control with bisoprolol, and is currently asymptomatic with a heart rate of 76bpm. Her recent ECHO is grossly normal. She has a high CHA2DS2VASc score and the cardiologist is planning to start her on oral anticoagulation. She has a PMH of severe OA, HTN and TIA. Her mobility is very poor and finds it very difficult to attend her hospital appointments, and confides in the cardiologist that she does often forget to take her pills, although she is now using a special box from the pharmacy which contains all the day’s medication – and she finds that very helpful indeed! What would be the most suitable option for anticoagulation?
###Options:
A. She is not suitable for anticoagulation
B. Aspirin 75mg OD
C. Warfarin titrated to her INR
D. Apixaban 5mg BD
E. Enocaparin 1.5mg/kg OD


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D Apixaban 5mg BD. This is a case of a patient with atrial fibrillation who is at high risk of stroke due to her age, history of severe OA and HTN, and has issues with medication compliance.

The most suitable option for anticoagulation in this case would be Apixaban 5mg BD. This is a relatively new oral anticoagulant which does not require any laboratory monitoring and has a fixed dosing regimen of 5mg BD. It is a good option for patients with issues such as poor mobility, multiple comorbidities and poor medication compliance, as it does not require any laboratory monitoring and is a fixed dose.

Aspirin 75mg OD is not the most suitable option for anticoagulation in this case. While it may be used as an alternative in patients who cannot tolerate oral anticoagulation, it does not have the same level of efficacy as the newer oral anticoagulants such as Apixaban.

Warfarin titrated to her INR is not the most suitable option for anticoagulation in this case. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and requires regular monitoring with an INR test to ensure the therapeutic range is maintained. It is not a suitable option for patients with issues such as poor mobility and medication compliance.

Enocaparin 1.5mg/kg OD is not the most suitable option for anticoagulation in this case. Enocaparin is a low molecular weight heparin and requires regular monitoring with an anti-Xa assay to ensure the therapeutic range is maintained. It is not a suitable option for patients with issues such as poor mobility and medication compliance.

Therefore, the most suitable option for anticoagulation in this case would be Apixaban 5mg BD.

###Question: A 28-year-old woman presents with a chief complaint of mood swings, irritability, and decreased interest in her usual activities. The patient reports experiencing episodes of intense sadness, low energy, and difficulty concentrating, alternating with periods of elevated mood, increased energy, and impulsivity. The patient has noticed these mood swings for the past 2 years, and they have become more frequent and disruptive to her daily life in the last 6 months. The patient is a teacher and has a stable social support system. She denies any alcohol or substance use. On review of systems, the patient denies any additional physical symptoms. Vital signs are blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, temperature 37.0 °C (98.6 °F). The provider decides to prescribe a drug that can target both elevated mood and depressive episodes. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of this drug in alleviating the patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A. Modulation of serotonin levels
B. Modulation of norepinephrine levels
C. Blockade of dopamine receptors
D. Activation of voltage-gated ion channels
E. Enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Modulation of serotonin levels.

Option A: Modulation of serotonin levels
This option is the correct answer. The patient's symptoms of mood swings, irritability, and decreased interest in activities are suggestive of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by abnormal levels of serotonin. The drug being prescribed, which alleviates the patient's symptoms, modulates serotonin levels.

Option B: Modulation of norepinephrine levels
Modulation of norepinephrine levels would not alleviate the patient's symptoms of mood swings and depressive episodes. Norepinephrine is primarily involved in the regulation of sympathetic outflow and blood pressure, and it does not play a significant role in mood regulation.

Option C: Blockade of dopamine receptors
Blockade of dopamine receptors would not alleviate the patient's symptoms of mood swings and depressive episodes. Dopamine is involved in the regulation of movement, motivation, and pleasure, and its blockade would not address the patient's symptoms of depression and hypomania.

Option D: Activation of voltage-gated ion channels
Activation of voltage-gated ion channels would not alleviate the patient's symptoms of mood swings and depressive episodes. Voltage-gated ion channels are involved in the generation and conduction of electrical impulses in nerve cells, and their activation would not address the patient's symptoms of mood swings and cognitive dysfunction.

Option E: Enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission
Enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission would not alleviate the patient's symptoms of mood swings and depressive episodes. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood and emotions, but its enhancement would not address the patient's specific symptoms.

###Options:
A. Increased cardiac output
B. Elevated heart rate
C. Increased blood pressure
D. Increased blood volume
E. reduced heart rate


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C: increased blood pressure. The cardiovascular changes in pregnancy are largely due to normal physiologic adjustments that occur in order to meet the increased metabolic demands of the mother and fetus. The cardiac output increases by 30-50% above nonpregnant levels. This increase is due to an increase in both stroke volume and heart rate. The blood pressure increases slightly, usually by 10-20 mmHg. The increase in blood pressure is due to a combination of increased renin production and decreased renal blood flow. The renin-angiotensin system is activated, which causes vasoconstriction and increases sodium and water retention.

He has no documented osteoporosis or thyroid dysfunction. His vitals are heart rate 40 bpm, blood pressure 86/40 mm Hg, oxygen saturation is 97% at room air, and respiratory rate 14 breaths/min. His clinical examination reveals cold, clammy skin, bilateral facial muscle spasms, and a postictal state with no obvious focal neurological deficits. His deep tendon reflexes are brisk. His electrocardiography (ECG) shows a prolonged QT interval. His laboratory investigations show serum-corrected calcium at 1.6 mmol/L (normal range is 2.1 to 2.5 mmol/L). Which condition is most likely to be associated with this presentation?
###Options:
A. Hypoparathyroidism
B. Sarcoidosis
C. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
D. Lung cancer
E. Tuberculosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Lung cancer. This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with hypercalcemia, which can be caused by various conditions including malignancy. Lung cancer is the most common cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy, accounting for approximately 40% of cases. 1,2 The most common mechanism underlying hypercalcemia in malignancy is the secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by the tumor cells. 3 PTHrP increases osteoclast activity, leading to increased bone resorption and subsequent release of calcium into the systemic circulation. 4 This patient's ECG findings of a prolonged QT interval are consistent with hypercalcemia. 5 Prolonged QT interval can increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, which can be life-threatening. 6 The patient's altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state are likely due to the severe hypercalcemia. 7 The patient's brisk deep tendon reflexes are also consistent with severe hypercalcemia. 8 The patient's hypocalcemia, which is evident by the prolonged QT interval on ECG, is likely due to the increased bone turnover and release of calcium from the bones, as seen in hypercalcemia of malignancy. 9 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. 10 The patient's prolonged QT interval on ECG is likely due to the severe hypercalcemia. 11 The patient's brisk deep tendon reflexes are also consistent with severe hypercalcemia. 12 The patient's altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state are likely due to the increased bone turnover and release of calcium from the bones, as seen in hypercalcemia of malignancy. 13 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. 14 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. 15 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. 16 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. 17 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. 18 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. 19 The patient's clinical presentation, including the altered sensorium, seizures, and postictal state, along with the prolonged QT interval on ECG, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and low serum calcium, is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of"

###Question: A 36-year-old woman with hypertension comes to the office because she thinks she may be “going through early menopause.” She has not had a menstrual period since her most recent office visit 6 months ago. During this time, she also has been “gaining weight around the middle” despite increased exercise; she has had a 6.3-kg (14-lb) weight gain. She has no other history of major medical illness. Her only medication is lisinopril. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 107 kg (236 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Pelvic ultrasonography shows oligohydramnios and a fetus with a misshapen cranium, pericardial effusion, small bladder, and echogenic bowel. Themost likely cause of the fetal abnormalities in this patient’s pregnancy is interference with which of the following?
###Options:
A. Fetal lung/epithelial differentiation
B. Fetal lung/surfactant development
C. Fetal renal hemodynamics
D. Maternal placental perfusion
E. Maternal prostaglandin synthesis


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Maternal prostaglandin synthesis. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with those of a fetus with a condition known as constriction band syndrome (also known as amniotic band syndrome or limb-body wall complex). This condition is caused by entrapment of a segment of the body during fetal development, resulting in a constriction band that impedes blood flow and other essential nutrients to the affected area. The fetal abnormalities seen in this case are likely due to interference with maternal prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins are essential for normal fetal development, and disruptions in their synthesis can lead to abnormalities in fetal tissue development.

###Options:
A. Chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the urethral sphincter leading to stress urinary incontinence, managed with Kegel exercises and anticholinergic medications
B. Urogenital atrophy and weakened pelvic floor muscles causing urge urinary incontinence, treated with vaginal estrogen cream and bladder training
C. Urethral stricture formation and detrusor underactivity resulting in overflow urinary incontinence, requiring intermittent catheterization and alpha-blockers
D. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to spinal cord schistosomiasis leading to mixed urinary incontinence, managed with clean intermittent catheterization and oxybutynin
E. Urethrovaginal fistula formation secondary to chronic infection causing continuous urinary incontinence, necessitating surgical repair and long-term antibiotic therapy


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B, urogenital atrophy and weakened pelvic floor muscles causing urge urinary incontinence, treated with vaginal estrogen cream and bladder training. Genitourinary schistosomiasis is caused by the parasitic worm Schistosoma haematobium, which is endemic in Africa and the Middle East. The parasite lives in the venous plexus of the bladder and surrounding tissues, causing chronic inflammation and fibrosis. This leads to stress urinary incontinence, which is the involuntary leakage of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure.

### Input:
###Question: A 65-year-old ECWA pastor with a history of poorly controlled diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, and hypertension presents with a recurrent open wound to the lateral aspect of the left ankle. He states that the wound has been present for several months. They have been treating it at home with local wound care, including sterile bandages and antibiotic ointment, without resolution. He notes that he has had previous wounds at this location, which have healed in the past, but this one has not. He denies systemic symptoms but admits having trouble getting around, as his feet and lower legs get painful with walking. On physical exam, there is rubor less than 2 cm around the border, trace serous drainage in the wound, a fibrotic base, and a thickened, raised border, and the area is tender to palpation. There is limited bleeding on debridement due to the fibrotic base's thickened nature. The patient's pulse is faint, and the skin on the feet is atrophic and dry. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment following this appointment?
###Options:
A. Referral for diabetic management and follow-up blood glucose
B. Weekly wound care with debridements, wound vac placement, and biological skin substitute placement
C. Vascular workup with arterial Doppler studies and ankle-brachial index
D. Wound punch biopsy to be sent for pathology
E. Antibiotics


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C, Vascular workup with arterial Doppler studies and ankle-brachial index. This patient's recurrent, non-healing wound, in a patient with poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and atrophic skin, is suspicious for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). CLTI is a progressive condition characterized by peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that has resulted in irreversible damage to the distal limb tissues. It is associated with poor wound healing and a high risk of amputation if left untreated.

The patient's risk factors for PAD include advanced age, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. The presence of a non-healing wound in a patient with these risk factors should raise suspicion for CLTI. The physical exam findings of a fibrotic base, thickened border, limited bleeding on debridement, and atrophic skin are consistent with this diagnosis. The fibrotic base is a result of microvascular damage and necrosis, leading to poor perfusion and chronic wound healing. The thickened border is a result of the fibrotic base and the development of collateral vessels, leading to a chronic inflammatory state and poor perfusion. The limited bleeding on debridement is due to the poor perfusion and collateral vessel development. The atrophic skin is a result of the chronic inflammatory state and poor perfusion.

The next step in management of this patient is to evaluate for CLTI. This can be done with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) test, which measures the ratio of the blood pressure in the ankle to the blood pressure in the arm. ABI less than 0.9 is suggestive of CLTI. If the ABI is greater than 0.9, further evaluation with imaging studies such as duplex ultrasound or computed tomography angiography may be warranted. If the ABI is less than 0.5, the presence of rest pain or non-healing wounds should prompt urgent vascular surgery evaluation.

Once CLTI is confirmed, the next step in management is limb salvage. This involves revascularization procedures to restore blood flow to the affected limb. The most common revascularization procedures for CLTI are endovascular procedures, such as angioplasty and stent placement. If these procedures are unsuccessful, surgical bypass may be necessary.

The patient's poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for poor wound healing and increased susceptibility to infection. Therefore, wound cultures should be obtained, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated. The patient's poorly controlled diabetes likely also contributes to his poor wound healing and increased risk of amputation. Therefore, diabetic management should be optimized, and the patient should be educated on the importance of good glycemic control to prevent further complications.

This patient's recurrent, non-healing wound, in the setting of multiple risk factors for CLTI, including advanced age, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and atrophic skin, is highly suggestive of CLTI. The next step in management should be evaluation for CLTI with an ABI test and possible surgical bypass if the ABI is not successful with endovascular procedures.

###Question: A four year old boy presents to the GP surgery with his mother. He has been feeling unwell for the past 3 weeks, with fevers, headaches and tiredness. His mother is concerned that he has been getting worse over time instead of better. He looks very pale and has many bruises and petechiae on his arms and legs, which have appeared spontaneously over the past week. Abdominal examination reveals an enlarged liver and spleen. An urgent full blood count shows: haemoglobin 68g/L (normal 120-180), platelets 25 (normal 150-450), white cell count 83 (normal 3.4-11.0). What is the most likely diagnosis in this child?
###Options:
A. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
B. Aplastic anaemia
C. Epstein-Barr virus
D. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
E. Lymphoma


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This child has a form of acute leukaemia known as lymphoblastic lymphoma, which is characterised by an overproduction of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow and other organs. The child's symptoms of fever, headache, tiredness and pallor are typical of leukaemia. The presence of bruises and petechiae is due to bleeding into the skin and muscles as the leukaemic cells infiltrate the bone marrow, reducing its production of healthy blood cells. The low haemoglobin level and low platelet count are also consistent with acute leukaemia. The enlarged liver and spleen are due to infiltration of these organs by leukaemic cells. The most common form of childhood leukaemia is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is characterised by an overproduction of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow and other organs. The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is very good, with a survival rate of over 90% in most cases. The treatment is based on chemotherapy, which is highly effective in treating the leukaemia, but can also have long-term side effects. The other options are not consistent with the symptoms described. Aplastic anaemia is a condition in which the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells. Epstein-Barr virus infection is usually a benign condition that causes a flu-like illness. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which can be either Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a condition in which there is a low platelet count, which can lead to easy bruising and bleeding.

He has a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, as well as acute pancreatitis that occurred two years ago. His clinician orders a series of X-rays and a technetium-99m radionuclide bone scan to evaluate the patient’s hip. Results of plain films show subchondral radiolucency, while the radionuclide bone scan shows a ring of increased uptake around a cold center. When gathering more information from the patient, which of the following is most likely to be found in his social history?
###Options:
A. Vegetarian diet
B. Alcohol abuse
C. Chlamydial infection
D. Recent travel
E. smoking


### Response: The correct answer is"," option D Recent travel.

Physical examination reveals that the cervix is dilated to 8 cm and effaced to 90%. The fetal heart rate is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Premature rupture of the membranes
B. Inactive phase of labor
C. Active phase of labor
D. Transition phase of labor
E. Second stage of labor


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Premature rupture of the membranes.

The patient's symptoms of regular and painful contractions, gush of fluid from the vagina, and dilated cervix are all consistent with the onset of labor. However, the membranes have not ruptured yet, so this is not the correct answer.

Option B, Inactive phase of labor, is unlikely because the cervix is dilated and effaced, indicating that the labor has begun.

Whichof the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s signs and symptoms?
###Options:
A. Abnormal copper metabolism
B. Decreased levels of vitamin D
C. Decreased lysyl hydroxylation of collagen
D. Defective synthesis of fibrillin
E. Defective synthesis of type I collagen


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D Defective synthesis of fibrillin. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1. Fibrillin is a major component of elastin-associated microfibrils, which provide tensile strength to connective tissues such as the extracellular matrix of the skin, lungs, and heart. The mutation in FBN1 leads to abnormal synthesis and deposition of fibrillin, resulting in the characteristic clinical signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome. Patients with Marfan syndrome often have tall, thin bodies with long, thin fingers and hands, along with other signs such as arachnodactyly (i.e., abnormally long, slender fingers and hands), a high-arched palate, and dissecting aortic aneurysms. The lens of the eye can be displaced anteriorly (i.e., into the anterior chamber), and the cornea can be very thin. Abnormal copper metabolism would result in abnormal copper levels in the body, but would not explain the specific symptoms and physical examination findings in this patient. Decreased levels of vitamin D would result in rickets, a disease characterized by soft bones and weak muscles, but would not explain the specific symptoms and physical examination findings in this patient. Decreased lysyl hydroxylation of collagen would result in abnormal collagen, but would not explain the specific symptoms and physical examination findings in this patient.

###Question: A 45-year-old man presents with 3 days of worsening fever, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. He denies a sore throat or runny nose. His history is significant for renal transplant, for which he takes immunosuppressants, including prednisone. Vital signs are temperature 39 °C (102.2 °F), heart rate 98 bpm, blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 84% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral diffuse crackles. Chest X-ray reveals bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities. A sample obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage reveals eosinophilic foamy alveolar material and numerous cup-shaped cyst-like organisms in the methenamine silver stain. Which of the following tests is most likely present?
###Options:
A. Soap bubble lesions on brain imaging
B. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase
C. Lung granuloma
D. Hemolytic anemia
E. Tuberculosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B, Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase.

In this case, the patient's presentation of fever, cough, dyspnea, and diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest imaging is consistent with an interstitial lung disease. The finding of eosinophilic foamy alveolar material and cyst-like organisms on bronchoalveolar lavage is indicative of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, malignancies, and organ transplant recipients. PCP is characterized by the presence of ""soap bubble"" lesions on brain imaging, which are areas of rarefaction within the cerebellum secondary to cystic enlargement of the cerebellar folia.

The patient's history of renal transplant and immunosuppressant therapy (prednisone) increases his risk of developing PCP. The presence of eosinophilic foamy alveolar material and cyst-like organisms on bronchoalveolar lavage further supports the diagnosis of PCP. Hemolytic anemia is not typically associated with PCP. Tuberculosis is not typically associated with PCP.

###Question: A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a runny nose, sneezing, and itching eyes on exposure to cats since childhood. Antiallergy drugs have not provided relief. Her symptoms improve with a program of desensitization involving administration of increasing doses of the allergen. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of the beneficial effect of this treatment?
###Options:
A. Formation of dimers that stimulate clearance by macrophage phagocytosis
B. Increased production of IgG antibodies that block allergen binding to mast cells
C. Overwhelming IgE binding sites to result in inactivation of mast cells
D. Production of an anti-idiotypic antibody to IgE that results in its clearance
E. Stimulation of macrophages to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: Overwhelming IgE binding sites to result in inactivation of mast cells. Desensitization involves the administration of increasing doses of the allergen. This results in an initial phase of increased IgE binding to mast cells, followed by a downregulation of IgE receptors on mast cells. This downregulation results in a decreased response to subsequent allergen exposure. The decreased response is due to the overwhelming of the mast cells by the large number of IgE molecules that are bound to the mast cells initially. This leads to a decreased release of histamine and other mediators of allergic reactions.

###Question: A 63-year-old man presents with wheezing and dyspnea on exertion. He has a 35-pack-year smoking history, as well as a medical history of coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are aspirin, atorvastatin, and metformin. Physical examination reveals marked bilateral wheezing. Laboratory test results including complete blood count and a basic metabolic profile are unremarkable. His spirometry this morning showed FEV1 of 75% and FEV1/FVC of 0.67. The clinician diagnoses the patient with COPD and prescribes a drug that is delivered via an inhaler. He tells the patient that the drug will cause some dizziness and blurring of vision. What is the mechanism of action of this drug?
###Options:
A. Beta-2 adrenergic agonist
B. Phosphodiesterases inhibitor
C. Anticholinergic
D. Lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitor
E. Antihistamine


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: Anticholinergic.

Anticholinergic drugs are used in the treatment of COPD because they reduce bronchoconstriction by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airways. These drugs work by blocking the action of acetylcholine, which causes bronchoconstriction.

Inhaling deeply and then exhaling forcefully against a closed glottis (the act of blowing out a cheek) is a classic maneuver used to demonstrate the presence of fixed airflow obstruction, as seen in COPD. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is often reduced to less than 50% of the predicted value. The FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio is usually less than 0.7.

The forced expiratory flow rate (FEFR) is the forced expiratory flow rate divided by the forced vital capacity (FVC). The FEFR is a useful measure of the severity of obstruction in COPD. The FEFR is usually less than 50% in patients with severe COPD.

The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the volume of air that is forcibly exhaled in 1 second. The FEV1 is a good measure of the amount of air that is exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver. The FEV1 is reduced in patients with COPD.

The forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the point of maximal inhalation. The FVC is a good measure of the amount of air that can be exhaled during the first second of a forced vital capacity maneuver. The FVC is reduced in patients with COPD.

The peak expiratory flow (PEF) is the maximum rate of airflow that can be generated during a forced expiratory maneuver. The PEF is a good measure of the rate of airflow during the first second of a peak expiratory flow maneuver. The PEF is reduced in patients with COPD.

The forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF) is the maximum rate of airflow that can be generated during the middle portion of a forced expiratory maneuver. The FEF is a good measure of the rate of airflow during the middle portion of a forced expiratory maneuver. The FEF is reduced in patients with COPD.

The residual volume (RV) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiration. The RV is increased in patients with COPD.

The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal inspiration. The FRC is increased in patients with COPD.

The total lung capacity (TLC) is the maximum volume of air that can be inspired from the point of maximal expiration. The TLC is increased in patients with COPD.

###Question: A patient from an African community presents with severe facial scarring following a traumatic injury. Which of the following reconstructive techniques is commonly used for scar revision in patients with skin of color?
###Options:
A. Dermabrasion
B. Fractional laser therapy
C. Chemical peel
D. Punch grafting
E. Scar excision with primary closure


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Fractional Laser Therapy. Fractional Laser Therapy is commonly used for scar revision in patients with skin of color. It uses a series of microscopic laser beams to treat only pa of the skin at a time, while sparing the surrounding skin. This allows for the targeted removal of only the scarred poions of the skin, while simultaneously stimulating the body's natural healing mechanisms to improve the appearance of the remaining, untreated skin. Dermabrasion involves the use of a sharp instrument, such as a scalpel or sandpaper, to gently scrape and resurface the skin. It is commonly used to smooth over facial scars. Chemical peels are used to resurface the skin by removing the top layer of the skin and replacing it with a solution that is slightly acidic or alkaline. Punch grafting involves the use of a special instrument to cut out individual sections of skin from a donor area, which are then used to fill in the scarred area. Excising the scar and closing the wound with sutures is the most direct way to remove a scar.

###Question:  65-year-old female comes in for the evaluation of difficulty in swallowing. She feels that the food gets stuck in her throat. Her medical history is significant for iron-deficiency anemia, for which she is taking iron supplements. Vital signs are pulse rate 70/min, blood pressure 102/62 mmHg, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 98.6 F (37 C). Physical examination is unremarkable except for pallor. Lab shows hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL, hematocrit 34%, white blood cell count 6500/microL, platelets 270,000/microL sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mEq/L, and creatinine 0.8 mg/dL. What other findings can be seen with this condition?
###Options:
A. Zenker diverticulum
B. Mallory Weiss tear
C. Esophageal varices
D. Esophageal web
E. Diverticulitis


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Esophageal web. This patient's difficulty in swallowing is likely due to a web in the esophagus. Esophageal webs are thin, membranous, non-cancerous growths that can develop in the esophagus. They are often associated with iron deficiency anemia, which the patient has. Iron deficiency can lead to a decrease in the amount of iron in hemoglobin, resulting in microcytic anemia. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the thyroid, resulting in decreased thyroid hormone production. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the pituitary, resulting in decreased production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This can lead to hypothyroidism. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the adrenal glands, resulting in decreased production of adrenal hormones. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of red blood cells. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the gastric mucosa, resulting in decreased production of gastric acid. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the pancreas, resulting in decreased production of insulin. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the liver, resulting in decreased production of hepcidin. Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron levels in the body. A decrease in hepcidin levels can lead to increased iron absorption from the gut, increased iron release from storage sites, and increased iron loss from the body. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the skin, resulting in a condition called dermatitis, herpetiformis, and gluten sensitivity (DHGS). DHGS is a skin condition characterized by itchy, red, and blistered patches on the skin. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the spleen, resulting in decreased production of platelets. Platelets are small, disk-shaped cells that help blood clot. A decrease in the amount of iron in the spleen can lead to a condition called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is characterized by low platelet counts and easy bruising. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the bones, resulting in osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weak and brittle bones. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the joints, resulting in joint pain and swelling. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the hair, resulting in hair loss. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the skin, resulting in a condition called pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is a condition characterized by low levels of vitamin B12, which is needed for the production of red blood cells. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the brain, resulting in a condition called cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment is a condition characterized by poor memory, difficulty concentrating, and slowed thinking. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. GI symptoms can include bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the thyroid, resulting in hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by low levels of thyroid hormones in the body. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the liver, resulting in hepatomegaly. Hepatomegaly is a condition characterized by enlargement of the liver. Iron deficiency can also cause a decrease in the amount of iron in the skin, resulting in a condition called pernio. Pernio is a condition characterized by the development of small, red, painful bumps on the nose, ears"

###Options:
A. BCL2 product blocks bax channels
B. Cytochrome c activates Apaf-1
C. FADD stimulates caspase 8
D. FADD stimulates caspase 8
E. TRADD stimulates FADD


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, FADD stimulates caspase 8. Fas (CD95) is a type of death receptor. It is a protein on the surface of many cell types. It is normally involved in the positive regulation of apoptosis. Fas binds to a Fas ligand (FasL) on another cell, triggering the cell to kill itself by activating a caspase. The caspase then activates other caspases, which in turn activate enzymes that degrade the cell's proteins and DNA. The Fas protein has a death domain, which is a region of about 50 amino acids that helps regulate the cell's life and death decisions. The death domain binds to a family of proteins called FADD (Fas-associated death domain), which in turn activates caspase 8. Caspase 8 is an enzyme that can cleave and activate other caspases.

###Question: A 45-year-old woman presents to her doctor with heartburn, indigestion and a sense of fullness after eating small meals. The history reveals that these symptoms occur more frequently after heavy meals. An endoscopy was ordered. Biopsies of her stomach showed elongated pits, expanded muscularis mucosae and lack of fundamental substance around the gastric glands. What is the most likely diagnosis based on these findings?
###Options:
A. Chronic gastritis
B. Peptic ulcer disease
C. Gastric adenocarcinoma
D. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
E. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)


### Response: The correct answer is"," D, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The patient's symptoms of heartburn, indigestion and sense of fullness after eating small meals are classic for gastrinoma. The endoscopy findings of elongated pits, expanded muscularis mucosae and lack of fundamental substance around the gastric glands are also consistent with gastrinoma. Gastrinoma is a tumor in the pancreas or duodenum that secretes excessive amounts of gastrin, leading to hypersecretion of gastric acid. This condition is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. The biopsy findings of expanded muscularis mucosae are consistent with the hyperplasia of the gastric antral mucosa that occurs in gastrinoma. The lack of fundamental substance around the gastric glands is due to the hyperplasia of the mucosa, which leads to crowding of the glands and loss of the normal architecture. The most common presentation of gastrinoma is with peptic ulcer disease, which is why the biopsy findings of expanded muscularis mucosae are often overlooked. The other conditions listed in the answer choices are not associated with the biopsy findings described.

###Question: A 60-year-old white woman with non ischemiccardiomyopathy returns to clinic for follow-up. Her EF is30% and she has NYHA class III symptoms despitetherapy with an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, andfurosemide.Which of the following agents if added to her regimencould lower mortality?
###Options:
A. Amlodipine
B. Spironolactone
C. Digoxin
D. Amiodarone
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Spironolactone. This patient has symptomatic hea failure despite optimal medical therapy. The addition of spironolactone, a mineralocoicoid receptor antagonist, can help to reduce the symptoms of hea failure and lower the moality associated with the disease. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that works by antagonizing aldosterone, a hormone that promotes sodium and water retention and potassium excretion. By antagonizing aldosterone, spironolactone decreases intravascular volume and preload, which can help to decrease symptoms of hea failure. Spironolactone is also known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, which can help to slow down the progression of hea failure.

###Question: You have been monitoring a 29-year-old woman in your clinic who has a history ofmechanical mitral valve replacement. She has been taking warfarin foranticoagulation since her valve was replaced 18 months ago. She now tells you thatshe is contemplating pregnancy.What is the most reasonable option for anticoagulation in this patient?
###Options:
A. Discontinue warfarin and initiate subcutaneous heparin twice daily to goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of at least twice the upper limit of the control, restart warfarin at the beginning of the second trimester, then switch back to subcutaneous heparin at around 36 weeks and continue this until delivery
B. Continue warfarin until week 36, keeping her INR between 2.5 and 3.5, then discontinue all anticoagulation and coordinate with her obstetrician to schedule an elective Caesarian section 5 days after the last dose of warfarin
C. Discontinue warfarin and initiate weight-based dose-adjusted low molecular weight I heparin until delivery so that there will not be a need to acquire blood work to monitor her anticoagulation
D. None of the above. Pregnancy is contraindicated
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Discontinue warfarin and initiate subcutaneous heparin twice daily to goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of at least twice the upper limit of the control, restart warfarin at the beginning of the second trimester, then switch back to subcutaneous heparin at around 36 weeks and continue this until delivery.
This option is the most reasonable because the patient has a mechanical mitral valve replacement, which carries a high risk of thromboembolic complications during pregnancy. The use of warfarin is contraindicated during pregnancy due to its potential to cause birth defects and miscarriages. The patient should be bridged to heparin while she is no longer on warfarin. She should resume warfarin after the second trimester, when the risk of thromboembolic events is lower.

###Question:  22-year-old woman nursing her newborn develops a tender erythematous area around the nipple of her left breast. A  thick, yellow fl uid is observed to drain from an open fissure.  Examination of this breast fluid under the light microscope will most likely reveal an abundance of which of the following inflammatory cells?
###Options:
A. Lymphocytes
B. Eosinophills
C. Mast cells
D. Neutrophils
E. Plasma cells


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Neutrophils. The patient has cracked nipple, a common cause of breast inflammation in nursing mothers. The underlying cause of cracked nipple is unknown, but it is thought to be due to the obstruction of milk ducts by keratin flakes. The keratin flakes are formed by the desquamation of the epithelial cells lining the ducts. The keratin accumulates in the ducts and forms a plug, which causes the duct to become narrow and constrict the milk as it attempts to flow out of the nipple. The inflammation is caused by the leakage of milk out of the ducts and into the surrounding breast tissue.

Inflammation of the breast is characterized by the accumulation of neutrophils in the affected area. Lymphocytes, eosinophills, mast cells, and plasma cells are not typically seen in inflammation of the breast.

### Input:
###Question: A 65-year-old woman has congestive heart failure for which she is treated with an appropriate drug regimen includingan ACE inhibitor. Because of insufficient improvement in her symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and edema, thephysician prescribes a second agent that results in hyperkalemia. This adverse effect most likely resulted from a drugthat targets which of the following labeled locations in the diagram of a nephron?
###Options:
A. A
B. B
C. C
D. D
E. E


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, which is the location of the sodium-potassium-chloride (Na+-K+-Cl-) sympoer in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The adverse effect described in the question is hyperkalemia, which is a common adverse effect of medications that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and specifically on the angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These medications work by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is the final step in the renin-angiotensin pathway. This inhibition leads to decreased levels of angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting hormone. By decreasing the levels of angiotensin II, these medications lead to decreased levels of aldosterone, which is responsible for reabsorbing sodium and water in the distal tubule and collecting duct. This results in decreased sodium reabsorption and increased water reabsorption, leading to decreased extracellular fluid volume and decreased blood pressure. However, one of the side effects of these medications is that they also inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the kidneys, which is responsible for the production of angiotensin-(1-9) (Ang-(1-9)), a vasodilator and antagonist of angiotensin II. This results in increased levels of angiotensin II, which leads to increased vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, which in turn leads to increased extracellular fluid volume and increased blood pressure. This increased blood pressure can lead to adverse effects such as congestive heart failure, which is the reason why these medications are often used in patients with congestive heart failure. The sodium-potassium-chloride (Na+-K+-Cl-) sympoer in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is responsible for reabsorbing chloride, potassium, and sodium from the tubular fluid into the bloodstream. It is not directly involved in the renin-angiotensin pathway, so it is unlikely that an adverse effect on this sympoer would result in hyperkalemia. The adverse effects of medications that target the Na+-K+-2Cl- sympoer in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle would most likely result in hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

###Question: A 65-year-old man is hospitalized with a fever, severe headache, and neck stiffness. His medical history included type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. His vital signs were temperature 102 °F (38.9 °C), heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 15 breaths/min. He was confused and had nuchal rigidity during the physical examination. Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain revealed short purple rods that were either single or in short chains. The patient was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone. What other antibiotics should be added based on the CSF Gram stain until final cultures are available?
###Options:
A. Chloramphenicol
B. Moxifloxacin
C. Ciprofloxacin
D. Ampicillin
E. cefixime


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Chloramphenicol:

The patient's presentation with fever, headache, neck stiffness, confusion, and presence of short purple rods on CSF Gram stain is consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The most common pathogens causing bacterial meningitis in adults include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Based on the CSF Gram stain, the most likely pathogen is S. pneumoniae, which is sensitive to penicillins and cephalosporins. Therefore, the antibiotics of choice for bacterial meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae are penicillins such as ampicillin or cephalosporins such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone.

Chloramphenicol is not the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis. It is primarily used as a second-line treatment for meningococcal meningitis, as it is effective against N. meningitidis. However, it is still a valid option for empiric treatment of suspected bacterial meningitis until final cultures are obtained and antibiotic sensitivities are known.

Moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, it is not the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis. It is primarily used as a second-line treatment for Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia.

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections and respiratory tract infections. However, it is not the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis. It is primarily used as a second-line treatment for L. pneumophila and M. pneumoniae pneumonia.

Ampicillin is a penicillin antibiotic that is effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae.

Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against many gram-negative organisms. It is the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis caused by N. meningitidis.

###Question: A 50-year-old female presents to your office for evaluation of solid food dysphagia without weight loss. Symptoms have been present for 6  months and are progressive. The patient has had two episodes of near impaction, but copious water ingestion and repeated swallows allowed the food bolus to pass. She has never had to present to the ER for disimpaction. She drinks five to six beers per day, loves spicy foods, and smokes a pack of cigarettes daily with a total lifetime history of 30  pack-years. She has had intermittent heartburn symptoms for years and has not sought treatment. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Review of symptoms reveals chronic cough. Physical examination is unremarkable. Upper endoscopy reveals a distal esophageal stricture with inflammatory changes. Esophageal biopsies reveal benign mucosa with chronic inflammation. Gastric biopsies are unremarkable.  Helicobacter pylori testing is negative. What is the most likely etiology of the patient’s stricture?
###Options:
A. alcohol ingestion
B. tobacco use
C. gastroesophageal reflux
D. hydrochlorothiazide
E. spicy food ingestion


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: gastroesophageal reflux. This patient's chronic cough, solid food dysphagia, and presence of a stricture in the distal esophagus are all consistent with a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is a condition characterized by the replacement of normal esophageal squamous epithelium with columnar metaplastic epithelium. It is strongly associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is the most likely etiology in this patient given her symptoms of heartburn and chronic cough, and the findings on endoscopy and biopsy.

Alcohol ingestion and smoking are associated with the development of esophageal strictures, but they are less likely to be the primary etiology in this patient given her history of GERD symptoms and the presence of a stricture in the distal esophagus. Hydrochlorothiazide use is associated with the development of esophageal candidiasis, but it is not a likely etiology in this patient given her symptoms and endoscopic findings. Spicy food ingestion is a risk factor for the development of esophageal strictures, but it is less likely to be the primary etiology in this patient given her symptoms and endoscopic findings.

###Question: A 41-year-old man presents with severe pain during every bowel movement over the last few weeks. The pain often lasts 5-45 minutes afterward and he is now afraid to have a bowel movement and has developed constipation. He reports some blood on the toilet paper when he wipes. His history is significant for ulcerative colitis. The physical examination is limited due to severe pain and does not reveal any masses or hemorrhoids. What is the most appropriate therapy?
###Options:
A. Sitz baths
B. high-fiber diet.
C. opical nitroglycerin ointment and surgery follow-up.
D. Laxatives, and topical nitroglycerin ointment.
E. Pain control, laxatives, Sitz baths, and GI referral.


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. The patient's symptoms are consistent with left-sided ulcerative colitis flare, which is causing severe rectal pain during bowel movements. The pain is likely due to the inflammation of the rectal mucosa. The most appropriate therapy is pain control, laxatives, Sitz baths, and GI referral. The patient should also be educated on the importance of a high-fiber diet and regular exercise to maintain remission of his ulcerative colitis.

Sitz baths, which are a form of hydrotherapy, can help relieve the pain associated with inflammatory bowel disease flares. They are also useful for hemorrhoids, incontinence, and anal fissures. Topical nitroglycerin ointment can also be used to help relieve the pain associated with ulcerative colitis flares. It is applied to the rectal mucosa twice daily and can help with the pain and spasms associated with the inflammation. Opical nitroglycerin ointment is also used to treat other types of pain, such as angina.

High-fiber diet and regular exercise are important components of maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. Laxatives are also recommended to help relieve constipation. Medications such as mesalamine, sulfasalazine, and corticosteroids can be used to treat active disease. Surgery is reserved for patients with complications of ulcerative colitis, such as toxic megacolon or colonic perforation.

###Options:
A. Hypothyroidism
B. Hyperthyroidism
C. Pelvic inflammatory disease
D. Endometrial hyperplasia
E. Pregnancy


### Response: The correct answer is"," option D, endometrial hyperplasia. This is a case of irregular uterine bleeding, which is a common symptom in endometrial hyperplasia. This is a common condition in premenopausal women, and it is often caused by an increase in estrogen levels, such as in women with an intact uterus or those who are taking hormonal birth control. The first step in evaluating a patient with irregular uterine bleeding is to determine whether the bleeding is consistent with an anovulatory or ovulatory cycle. This can be done by keeping a record of the patient's baseline cycle and then comparing it to the current cycle. If the cycle is longer or more variable than the baseline, it is likely anovulatory. If the cycle is shorter or more consistent than the baseline, it is likely ovulatory. If the cycle is not consistent with either ovulatory or anovulatory bleeding, then endometrial hyperplasia should be considered.

###Question: A 53 year old woman has presented to GP complaining that her eyes look unusual, compared to photos from when she was younger. Her vision itself is no worse. On examination she has chemosis, exophthalmos, lid lag, lid retraction and ophthalmoplegia. She feels well in herself and is apyrexial. What is the most appropriate initial investigation to undertake?
###Options:
A. Chest Xray
B. orbital ultrasound
C. reactive protein
D. Thyroid function test
E. Lyme serology


### Response: The correct answer is"," thyroid function test. This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of thyroid eye disease (TED), also known as Graves' ophthalmopathy. It is a manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease, most commonly Hashimoto's thyroiditis, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to hyperthyroidism. The most common symptom of TED is unilateral or bilateral eye enlargement, which may be associated with proptosis, chemosis, lid lag, lid retraction, and ophthalmoplegia. The most appropriate initial investigation to undertake is thyroid function test (TSH) to establish whether the patient has hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. If the TSH is low, then the diagnosis is most likely hypothyroidism and the patient should be investigated for underlying causes such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. If the TSH is high, then the diagnosis is most likely hyperthyroidism and the patient should be investigated for underlying causes such as Graves' disease. If the TSH is normal, then the diagnosis is most likely a mixture of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, known as euthyroid sick syndrome. In this case, the patient would need to be investigated for underlying causes such as infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. If no cause is found, then the diagnosis is most likely TED. If the patient has symptoms of thyroid eye disease, then the most appropriate initial investigation is thyroid eye ultrasound. This is a non-invasive imaging technique that can show the presence of enlarged extraocular muscles, which is a characteristic feature of TED. If the ultrasound is normal, then the diagnosis is most likely euthyroid sick syndrome. If the ultrasound shows enlarged extraocular muscles, then the diagnosis is most likely TED. If no cause is found on ultrasound, then the diagnosis is most likely TED. If the patient has symptoms of thyroid eye disease, then the most appropriate initial investigation is thyroid eye CT scan. This is an invasive imaging technique that can show the presence of enlarged extraocular muscles, which is a characteristic feature of TED. If the CT scan is normal, then the diagnosis is most likely euthyroid sick syndrome. If the CT scan shows enlarged extraocular muscles, then the diagnosis is most likely TED. If no cause is found on CT scan, then the diagnosis is most likely TED.

### Input:
###Question: A 45-year-old Chinese immigrant presents with a swelling over the neck. The patient has recently moved to the USA, and she has no documented medical history available. However, the patient neither has any history suggestive of past malignancies, prior surgical history, nor any relevant medical history. She is anxious that she may have cancer as her friend told her that ''neck lumps are generally fatal''. The swelling is determined to be a solitary, mobile nodule. An ultrasound is done, which reveals a small round lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid, without any calcifications or surrounding tissue changes. The nodule has a uniform echotexture. An FNA performed reveals a follicular neoplasm. Assuming that the nodule is benign, which additional point on history would explain the occurrence of follicular neoplasms?
###Options:
A. Diet and geographic history
B. History of prior radiation
C. History of trauma to the neck
D. History of recent fever
E. History of recent travel


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Diet and geographic history. The patient's history of diet and geographic history is the most likely explanation for the occurrence of follicular neoplasms. The patient is Chinese, and her history of diet and geographic location is significant. The Chinese population has a higher incidence of thyroid nodules, and follicular neoplasms are more common in this population. The incidence of thyroid nodules is also higher in patients with a history of iodine deficiency. The patient's history of diet and geographic location would suggest a higher likelihood of iodine deficiency, which would explain the occurrence of follicular neoplasms.

He makes recovers spontaneously and is discharged several days later, with no clear cause for his syncope being identified. Serial resting ECGs over several days shows coved ST elevation with no chest pain or elevated cardiac enzymes. There is no other abnormality on his ECG and ECHO is normal. He is referred to cardiology for further investigation. At clinic he reveals that two of his uncles have suddenly died at a very young age, and is very concerned the same may happen to him. He mentions that his girlfriend has woken him up several nights to check he is okay and his breathing ‘goes funny’ sometimes during the night.

###Options:
A. Below-normal arterial PO2
B. Below-normal arterial PCO2
C. Greater than normal arterial blood pressure
D. Lower than normal pulmonary arterial pressure
E. None of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Below-normal arterial PO2. The ductus arteriosus is a fetal connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery that allows blood to bypass the fetus' lungs. In a newborn, the ductus arteriosus should close within 24 hours after birth. If it fails to close, the infant will have above-normal arterial blood pressure, above-normal arterial PCO2, and above-normal pulmonary arterial pressure. The infant will have below-normal arterial PO2 because the left ventricle must pump blood through the lungs, which decreases the amount of oxygenated blood that reaches the body.

###Question: A 5-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother because of a 10-day history of “coughing spells” that occur several times daily and last 1 to 2 minutes; he often vomits afterwards. He was delivered at term to a 16-year-old patient, gravida 1, para 1, following an uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery in Mexico. His parents immigrated to the USA shortly after his birth. He has no history of major medical illness and receives no medications. He has never been to a physician for a well-child examination and has not received any vaccinations. He appears well. Vital signs, including oxygen saturation, are within normal limits. During the physical examination, he coughs uncontrollably for 2 minutes, after which there is a gasping sound and subsequent vomiting. Afterwards, he appears exhausted.

### Input:
###Question: A 16-year-old boy is brought to the clinic for a well-child examination. His vaccinations are up to date. At the age of 18 months, he received the meningococcal vaccine due to a meningococcus outbreak. Within hours of the vaccine, the boy developed a fever and generalized seizure that lasted about 2 minutes. He was taken to the emergency department for observation and subsequently discharged. He has had no further seizures or other medical problems and takes no medications. Family history is positive for an uncle with febrile seizures during childhood. Vital signs and physical examination are normal. The child is due for a booster dose of the meningococcal vaccine. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for this patient's management?
###Options:
A. Discontinue immunizations
B. Administer the booster dose of the meningococcal vaccine
C. Perform electroencephalogram
D. Perform electroencephalogram
E. None


### Response: The correct answer is"," B: Administer the booster dose of the meningococcal vaccine. This patient had a febrile seizure after receiving the meningococcal vaccine at the age of 18 months. Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure in children. They are usually caused by a rise in body temperature, such as from a viral illness or a vaccination. The risk of seizures increases with age, with the highest risk being in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. The risk of seizures after receiving the meningococcal vaccine is extremely low, with less than 1% of individuals experiencing a febrile seizure after receiving the vaccine. The risk of seizures after receiving the meningococcal vaccine is similar to the risk of seizures in children who have not received the vaccine. Therefore, there is no reason to discontinue immunizations or perform an electroencephalogram (EEG) in this patient. The meningococcal vaccine is a safe and effective way to prevent meningococcal disease, which is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection.

### Response: The correct answer is"," D, vitamin K. This woman is suffering from a warfarin-induced skin necrosis and bleeding (SINB) syndrome. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K. When vitamin K is deficient, the anticoagulant effect of warfarin accumulates, leading to skin necrosis and bleeding in various tissues. The prolonged PT and PTT indicate that the patient is in a hypercoagulable state. Vitamin K is a cofactor for the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X.

###Options:
A. With proper supportive care, the overall mortality rate is low
B. With her progressive liver dysfunction, increased total serum bilirubin is anticipated
C. Administration of N-acetylcysteine is first-line therapy
D. Seizures are uncommon with this condition.
E. Death is usually associated with increased intracranial pressures and herniation


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Seizures are uncommon with this condition. The patient in question is suffering from Reye syndrome, a rare condition that is associated with a high mortality rate. Reye syndrome is characterized by the triad of: Fever, especially high fever (>38.5degC) Aminotransferase elevation (>5 times normal) Generalized seizures. The condition is often fatal, with death occurring from increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The pathogenesis of Reye syndrome is poorly understood, but it is thought to be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. The condition is most commonly seen in children between 2 and 10 years of age, and it is most commonly precipitated by viral infections, including influenza. The condition is rare, but it is important to recognize it, as prompt treatment is essential to prevent progression of the condition. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, including intravenous fluids, liver protection, and avoidance of precipitating factors such as fever. There is no specific treatment for Reye syndrome, and N-acetylcysteine is not recommended.

His father, maternal aunt, and paternal uncle all died of myocardial infarctions under the age of 50 years. Physical examination shows tendinous xanthomas on the hands and thickened Achilles tendons. Serum lipid studies show a total cholesterol concentration of 410 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol concentration of 30 mg/dL, and triglyceride concentration of 140 mg/dL. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following?
###Options:
A. Apo B48
B. Apo C
C. HMG-CoA reductase activity
D. LDL receptor
E. Lipoprotein lipase activity


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: LDL receptor. The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia, xanthomas, and a family history of early myocardial infarctions, all of which are consistent with familial hypercholesterolemia (type IIa). Deficiency of the LDL receptor leads to increased LDL levels, which accumulate in the blood and are taken up by macrophages in tissues, including the arterial intima. The macrophages become foam cells, which contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Apo B48 is a component of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), not LDL. Apo C is a component of HDL, not LDL. HMG-CoA reductase is the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Deficiency of this enzyme would not lead to hypercholesterolemia. Lipoprotein lipase is the enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) to yield fatty acids and glycerol. Deficiency of this enzyme would not lead to hypercholesterolemia.

What is the most likely cause of these findings?
###Options:
A. Thiamin deficiency
B. Vitamin A excess
C. Thrombocytopenia
D. Vitamin C deficiency
E. Vitamin A deficiency


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D Vitamin A deficiency. The patient's symptoms of a rash, hyperkeratotic papules, perifollicular hemorrhages, corkscrew hairs, bleeding gums, and bruises are all consistent with a diagnosis of acanthosis nigricans, which is a cutaneous marker of vitamin A deficiency. Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by hyperkeratotic papules on the skin, typically on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, axillae, and groin. It is associated with a number of conditions, including alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, and hepatic disease. The papules are often described as having a ""bread-crumb"" appearance. The papules are also associated with perifollicular hemorrhages, which can be visualized with dermoscopy. The corkscrew hairs are a result of the follicular plugging caused by the perifollicular hemorrhages. The bleeding gums and bruises are a result of the vitamin K deficiency that often accompanies vitamin A deficiency. Thiamin deficiency can lead to a condition called beriberi, which is characterized by neuropathy and cardiovascular symptoms. Vitamin A excess can lead to toxicity, but this is not associated with the skin findings described in the question. Thrombocytopenia can lead to purpura, but the bleeding gums and bruises are not typical of this condition.

###Question:  A randomized clinical trial is conducted to compare wound healing and cosmetic differences between two surgical procedures for closing skin wounds following cesarean delivery. A total of 1000 women undergoing cesarean delivery during a 6-month period are enrolled in the study, which was 85% of the total number of patients undergoing the procedure. The results show a wound infection rate of 12 cases per 1000 women for Procedure A and 18 cases per 1000 women for Procedure B. Which of the following is the best estimate of the absolute risk reduction for wound infection following Procedure A compared with Procedure B?
###Options:
A. (18/1000) – (12/1000)
B. 0.85 × (12/1000)
C. 0.85 × (18/1000)
D. [0.85 × (18/1000–12/1000)]
E. [(1.2/100) – (1.8/100)]/(1.8/100)


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: [0.85 × (18/1000 – 12/1000)]/(1.8/100).
This calculation is based on the following assumptions:

The risk of wound infection with Procedure A is 12/1000 women, and the risk of wound infection with Procedure B is 18/1000 women.
The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is calculated by subtracting the risk of wound infection with Procedure B from the risk of wound infection with Procedure A.
The ARR is (18/1000 – 12/1000) = 0.85 × 100/1000 = 0.85 × 1/10 = 0.85.
The relative risk reduction (RRR) is calculated by dividing the ARR by the risk of wound infection with Procedure B.
The RRR is (18/1000 – 12/1000) / (18/1000) = 0.85 × 1/18 = 0.85/18 = 0.44.
The 95% confidence interval for the ARR is calculated by taking the mean of the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the RRR.
The 95% confidence interval for the ARR is (0.85 × 0.85 – 0.44 × 0.85) / 0.85 = (0.85 – 0.44) / 0.85 = (0.41 – 0.57) / 0.5.
The correct answer is Option D: [0.85 × (18/1000 – 12/1000)]/(1.8/100).
The ARR is (18/1000 – 12/1000) / (18/1000) = 0.85 × 1/18 = 0.85/18 = 0.44.
The 95% confidence interval for the ARR is (0.41 – 0.57) / 0.5 = (0.41 – 0.57) / 0.025 = (0.41 – 0.57) / 0.475 = (0.38 – 0.56).

The infant's liver is able to conjugate the bilirubin, but the high concentration of bilirubin in the bloodstream overwhelms the capacity of the infant's liver to conjugate all of the bilirubin. The infant's liver is able to excrete the unconjugated bilirubin into the bile, but not the conjugated bilirubin. The infant's liver is able to excrete the unconjugated bilirubin into the bile, but not the conjugated bilirubin. The infant's liver is able to excrete the unconjugated bilirubin into the bile, but not the conjugated bilirubin. The infant's liver is able to excrete the unconjugated bilirubin into the bile, but not the conjugated bilirubin.

###Question: A 21-year-old male has had an extraction of an impacted third molar tooth under general anaesthetic. Postoperatively he continues tobleed from the surgical site. Despite surgical exploration and packing, bleeding continues. His coagulation screen reveals both a prolonged bleeding time and activated partial thromboplastin time(APTT), but the prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count are within normal limits. The patient mentions that his father bruises quiteeasily. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A. Haemophilia
B. Haemolytic uremic syndrome
C. Hemophilia B
D. von Willenbrand disease
E. Factor v laden deficiency


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Haemophilia Haemophilia A and B are inherited bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency of clotting factors VIII and IX, respectively. They are X-linked recessive disorders and therefore affect males and females equally. The incidence of haemophilia A is approximately 1 in 10,000 male births and the incidence of haemophilia B is approximately 1 in 25,000 male births. The prevalence of both diseases is approximately 1 in 100,000. The clinical manifestations of haemophilia are variable. The most common presentation is with prolongation of the bleeding time. Bleeding into weight-bearing joints may cause pain and swelling. Bleeding into muscles may cause weakness. Bleeding into the skin may result in ecchymoses or hematomas. Bleeding into the central nervous system may cause intracranial haemorrhage. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating a prolonged aPTT with a normal PT. Haemophilia B (Christmas disease) is caused by a deficiency of factor IX. It is also an X-linked recessive disease. The incidence is approximately 1 in 100,000 male births. The prevalence is approximately 1 in 1000. The clinical manifestations of haemophilia B are similar to haemophilia A. Haemophilia C is caused by a deficiency of factor XI. It is also an X-linked recessive disease. The incidence is approximately 1 in 1000 male births. The prevalence is approximately 1 in 1000. The clinical manifestations of haemophilia C are similar to haemophilia A and B. Haemophilia A, B and C all have a similar presentation with a prolonged aPTT and a normal PT. Haemophilia A and B are associated with a deficiency of factor VIII and factor IX, respectively. Haemophilia C is associated with a deficiency of factor XI. The deficiency in all three conditions is caused by the absence of a clotting factor. The absence of a clotting factor leads to a prolonged aPTT and a normal PT.

###Question: A 70-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation presents to the clinic complaining of imbalance while walking, leading to several falls in the last 5 months. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves and motor strength testing. Sensation to proprioception and vibration is reduced in both the lower extremities and the hands. Deep tendon reflexes at the ankle and the knee are absent bilaterally. Which of the following additional findings will support a purely sensory neuropathy over an underlying cerebellar lesion?
###Options:
A. Unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk
B. Unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, absence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body regardless if eyes are open or closed), and inability to perform a tandem walk
C. Absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, absence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body regardless if eyes are open or closed), and inability to perform a tandem walk
D. Absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk
E. Presence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: ""Absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk.""

The presence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing and the Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open) are indicative of a cerebellar lesion. The inability to perform a tandem walk is also suggestive of a cerebellar lesion. However, the absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing and the presence of the Romberg sign are more indicative of a cerebellar lesion rather than a sensory neuropathy.

The Romberg sign is a clinical test used to assess balance and is positive in patients with a cerebellar lesion due to the loss of the proprioceptive input from the lower limbs. It is characterized by the patient swaying to the side of the lesion when attempting to stand with the feet together and eyes closed. The Romberg sign is not seen in a pure sensory neuropathy.

The presence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing is indicative of a cerebellar lesion. In a pure sensory neuropathy, the patient would have bilateral loss of sensation, resulting in a loss of dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing.

The absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing and the presence of the Romberg sign are more indicative of a cerebellar lesion rather than a sensory neuropathy. Therefore, the answer is Option D: ""Absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing and the presence of the Romberg sign.""

### Input:
###Question: A 57-year-old man with chronic low back pain comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. Thepatient's last visit to the office was 2 years ago, and today he says he is ""doing about the same,"" except for anunintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight gain. He attributes the weight gain to inability to exercise because of his back pain,and he is now considering applying for disability benefits. He was evaluated by a back pain specialist 3 months ago andunderwent an MRI of the lumbar spine at that time; however, he says he did not understand the specialist's explanationregarding the MRI results and requests further explanation. Medical history also is remarkable for hyperlipidemia,seasonal allergies, and opioid use disorder; he has not used opioids of any kind since he stopped prescription oxycodoneuse 5 years ago. Routine medications are atorvastatin, diclofenac, and loratadine. He develops skin flushing when takingniacin, but he has no known drug allergies. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 25 years. He previouslydrank two beers daily, but he has not consumed any alcoholic beverages or used any recreational drugs for the past 5years. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits;blood pressure is 128/70 mm Hg. While standing, the patient leans forward slightly. Range of motion on lumbarextension and flexion is decreased. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Results of fastingserum studies are shown:Na  140 mEq/LK  4.7 mEq/LCl− 100 mEq/LHCO3− 24 mEq/LUrea nitrogen 15 mg/dLCreatinine 0.7 mg/dL45Cholesterol total 230 mg/dLHDL 60 mg/dLLDL 154 mg/dLTriglycerides 80 mg/dLMRI of the lumbar spine is shown. Which of the following factors in this patient's history most strongly contributed tothe MRI findings?
###Options:
A. Alcohol consumption
B. Cigarette smoking
C. Diclofenac use
D. Loratadine use
E. Opioid use


### Response: The correct answer is"," opioid use:

The patient's history of opioid use disorder is a significant contributor to the MRI findings. Opioid medications can cause structural changes in the spine, including ligament ossification and bone marrow hyperplasia, which can lead to back pain and stiffness. The MRI findings of ligament ossification and bone marrow hyperplasia in the lumbar spine are consistent with the patient's history of opioid use disorder.

The other factors listed in the question, such as alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and use of diclofenac and loratadine, are not known to cause structural changes in the spine and are not likely to be the primary contributors to the MRI findings in this patient.

###Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department after ingesting a large amount of over-the-counter pain medication in a suicide attempt approximately 1 day before arrival. He is not forthcoming about the event but reports abdominal pain and vomiting. On exam, the patient appears mildly confused, and his right upper abdominal quadrant is tender to palpation. Which of the following would most likely be found in this patient?
###Options:
A. Oxygen saturation of 85% on non-rebreather
B. Finger-stick glucose of 34 mg/dL
C. International normalized ratio of 3.1
D. Urinalysis positive for protein
E. None


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: International normalized ratio of 3.1.

The patient's presentation of abdominal pain, vomiting, and tenderness in the right upper quadrant is concerning for hepatic toxicity from the over-the-counter medication. The most likely cause of hepatic toxicity in this case is acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen overdose can lead to hepatic centrilobular necrosis, which can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. The most common cause of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is overdose, which can be seen in suicide attempts or over-the-counter medication misuse.

The patient's presentation of mild confusion is also concerning for hepatic toxicity. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity can cause hepatic encephalopathy, which can present with altered mental status. The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant are also concerning for hepatic toxicity. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity can cause right upper quadrant pain due to hepatic congestion and hepatic enlargement.

The patient's presentation of oxygen saturation of 85% on a non-rebreather suggests respiratory compromise, which is not typically seen in acetaminophen toxicity. Acetaminophen toxicity does not typically cause respiratory compromise, and the patient's presentation is more consistent with hepatic toxicity.

The patient's presentation of a finger-stick glucose of 34 mg/dL is also concerning for hepatic toxicity. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity can cause hypoglycemia due to impaired gluconeogenesis in the liver. This is not a common side effect of acetaminophen overdose, but it can be seen in severe cases.

The patient's presentation of an international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.1 is also concerning for hepatic toxicity. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity can cause an elevated INR due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors in the liver. This is not a common side effect of acetaminophen overdose, but it can be seen in severe cases.

The patient's presentation of urinalysis positive for protein is not consistent with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity does not typically cause proteinuria. The presence of proteinuria in this patient is more likely due to another cause, such as a glomerular disease or renal pathology.

The patient's presentation of mild confusion and finger-stick glucose of 34 mg/dL is not consistent with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity does not typically cause altered mental status or hypoglycemia. The presence of these symptoms in this patient is more likely due to another cause, such as an underlying encephalopathy or sepsis.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be an elevated INR of 3.1 due to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity can cause elevated INRs due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors in the liver. This elevated INR would be consistent with the patient's presentation of an elevated liver enzyme and hepatic congestion.

### Input:
###Question: A 28-year-old G1A1 woman presents to a gynecology clinic with a chief complaint of reduced menstrual flow for the past 6 months, especially last month. She denies any pain with menstruation or irregularity in her cycle. She says that she had an elective termination by dilation and curettage approximately 9 months ago. She is sexually active with one partner and always uses condoms. Review of her records indicates a past history of abnormal Pap smears, but she has not been followed recently. She denies any history of irregular menses and says that the age of menarche was 13 years. She takes no medications. Physical examination reveals a normally developed 68-kg (150-lb) woman who is 183 cm (6 ft) tall. She is in no acute distress. A β-human chorionic gonadotropin test from her original visit 1 week ago is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Asherman’s syndrome
B. Cervical stenosis
C. Endometrial cancer
D. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
E. Pregnancy


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A, Asherman's syndrome.
The patient's history of dilation and curettage, along with the subsequent history of abnormal Pap smears, is suggestive of a procedure-related complication. Asherman's syndrome is characterized by adhesions and fibrosis of the endometrium, which can result in secondary amenorrhea. The patient's history of irregular menses and the physical examination findings of a normally developed woman are consistent with this diagnosis.

Asherman's syndrome can be caused by overzealous dilation and curettage, which destroys the endometrium and can lead to subsequent adhesions. It is more common in developing countries where abortion is not legal or accessible. The β-human chorionic gonadotropin test is negative, indicating that the patient is not pregnant.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Cervical stenosis is unlikely in a 28-year-old woman. Endometrial cancer is unlikely in a patient with regular menses and no risk factors. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is unlikely in a patient with regular menses and no history of hormonal contraceptive use. Pregnancy is unlikely in a patient with a history of dilation and curettage.

###Question: A 65-year-old man with a history of advanced-stage renal failure, hypertension, and metastatic melanoma treated with paclitaxel and zoledronic acid is admitted to the hospital with acute cancer-associated bone pain from a lytic lesion in the thoracic spine. His neurological examination is normal, but his kidney function has worsened with his current GFR of 29. In addition to opioid and radiation therapy, what else could be used in his pain management?
###Options:
A. Epidural steroid therapy
B. Ketorolac 30 mg IV every 8 hours
C. Denosumab 120 mg daily for 3 weeks
D. Oral dexamethasone 4 mg twice a day
E. physical therapy


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Oral dexamethasone 4 mg twice a day. This patient is experiencing severe bone pain secondary to a lytic lesion in the thoracic spine, which is likely a consequence of his recent treatment with paclitaxel and zoledronic acid. This is a common side effect of these medications and can be very debilitating. The use of opioids and radiation therapy are often insufficient to control the pain, and other measures are needed. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat pain secondary to bone metastases. It works by reducing inflammation and the osteoclastic activity that leads to bone destruction. Dexamethasone is often given in a higher dose (4 mg twice a day) than the 2 mg twice a day used in this case.

A. Comminuted fracture of the ethmoid bone
B. Discontinuity in the left petrous temporal bone
C. Transverse fracture of the right temporal bone
D. Osseous defect in the cribriform plate
E. Longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Discontinuity in the left petrous temporal bone. This patient's presentation of periorbital ecchymosis with tarsal plate sparing and hemotympanum, along with the left-sided complete facial weakness, is highly suggestive of a temporal bone fracture. The most likely fracture to involve the temporal bone is a linear fracture, also known as a longitudinal fracture. The fracture line runs parallel to the long axis of the bone. In this case, the fracture line is located on the left side of the skull, which is consistent with the patient's presentation of left-sided complete facial weakness. The most common site of a temporal bone fracture is the squamous temporal bone, which is located on the lateral side of the skull. The fracture line in this case would most likely involve the left temporal bone, as seen in Option B. The next most likely location of the fracture line would be the sphenoid bone, which is located in the middle of the skull. The fracture line in this case would most likely involve the right temporal bone, as seen in Option C. The next most likely location of the fracture line would be the occipital bone, which is located at the back of the skull. The fracture line in this case would most likely involve the right occipital bone, as seen in Option D. The least likely location of the fracture line would be the frontal bone, which is located in the forehead. The fracture line in this case would most likely involve the left frontal bone, as seen in Option E.

###Question: A 58-year-old female ceramics worker with a COPD exacerbation has recently been discharged from the hospital. This is the third hospitalization in the past year for this condition, although the patient reports only mild symptoms in between exacerbations. The patient is currently still on the same drug regimen prior to her admission of salmeterol inhalation twice daily and tiotropium inhalation once daily. Her current FEV1 is below 60%. Which of the following would be an appropriate change in her medication regimen?
###Options:
A. Chronic systemic corticosteroids.
B. Discontinue the tiotropium
C. Discontinue the salmeterol
D. Change the salmeterol to a combination product that  includes both a LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid
E. Theophylline


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Change the salmeterol to a combination product that includes both a LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid.

The patient is currently on a combination product of salmeterol and tiotropium, which are both long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). LABAs are generally well-tolerated and effective in improving lung function and symptoms in patients with COPD. However, the patient has had multiple exacerbations in the past year, indicating that her symptoms may be poorly controlled. A change to a different LABA may not be sufficient to control her symptoms. Therefore, the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) would be appropriate to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve control of her symptoms.

Options A, B, and E are not appropriate choices as they do not address the patient's need for improved control of her symptoms. 

Option E: Theophylline is not a recommended treatment for COPD and is not indicated in this patient's case.

He is also concerned about a 75-pound (34 kg) weight gain over the last 2 years. He has smoked cigarettes for 20 years and wants to quit. Following 3 separate 6-week trials of sertraline, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine, he has no improvement in his symptoms. On physical exam, his BMI is 42 kg/m2. The remainder of his exam is unremarkable. What is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate medication for this patient?
###Options:
A. Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor
B. 5-HT1A partial agonist
C. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
D. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
E. none


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This patient's persistent symptoms of depression despite adequate trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) suggest that he may have a dual diagnosis of major depressive disorder and obesity. The weight gain and poor response to antidepressants are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's BMI of 42 kg/m2 indicates that he is morbidly obese, which is a significant risk factor for poor response to antidepressants. The most appropriate medication for this patient is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), such as duloxetine or venlafaxine. These medications have been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression in patients with obesity. They also have a lower risk of sexual side effects and weight gain compared to other antidepressants.

###Question: An 80-year-old woman presents complaining of a persistent skin rash, recurrent episodes of diarrhea, and moments of confusion over the past few months. She has lived alone since her husband passed away, has no known medical conditions, and takes no medications. She denies using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She refers to having a diet consisting primarily of corn-based products due to having a limited budget. Her vitals are weight 52 kg (114.6 lb.), height 153 cm (5 ft 0.2 in), BMI 22.2 kg/m2, blood pressure 135/75 mm Hg, and heart rate 78 bpm. Physical examination reveals a symmetric, rough, scaly, and darkly pigmented rash on sun-exposed areas and a bright red tongue. Laboratory assessments reveal a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 105 fL. Serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and liver function tests are within normal ranges. After establishing a diagnosis, the provider starts treatment with a specific supplement. What is the mechanism of action of the nutritional intervention most likely to alleviate this patient’s symptoms?
###Options:
A. Facilitates calcium absorption in the intestines
B. Facilitates calcium absorption in the stomach
C. Acts as a precursor for coenzymes involved in DNA repair
D. Acts as a coenzyme in glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis
E. Prevents oxidative damage by neutralizing free radicals


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D, Acts as a coenzyme in glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis.

The patient's symptoms of skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion, along with the presence of a darkly pigmented rash on sun-exposed areas, suggest a possible diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's diet of corn-based products, which are low in vitamin B12 and folate, along with the presence of a rough, scaly, and darkly pigmented rash, are classic findings of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, and its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia. The body's primary source of vitamin B12 is food of animal origin, including meat, fish, and dairy products. Vitamin B12 deficiency can be caused by a lack of dietary intake, malabsorption, or increased requirements. In this case, the patient's diet of corn-based products likely contributes to her vitamin B12 deficiency.

The mechanism of action of the nutritional intervention most likely to alleviate this patient's symptoms is Option D, Acts as a coenzyme in glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to impaired DNA synthesis and cell division, resulting in the development of megaloblastic anemia. The body's primary response to vitamin B12 deficiency is to increase its production of methionine synthase, an enzyme involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This increased production of methionine synthase leads to increased demand for vitamin B12, further exacerbating the deficiency.

Treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency involves supplementation with vitamin B12 itself, which acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic reactions, including glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. This helps to alleviate the body's increased demand for vitamin B12 and restore normal cell function.

She has recently emigrated to the United States and has noknown medical history. On physical examination, she has fixedsplitting of 52 and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur noted at the leftupper sternal border. An echocardiogram is performed, whichdemonstrates that the right atrium is moderately enlarged withevidence of a sinus venosus atrial septal defect.What other congenital anomaly is associated with this finding?
###Options:
A. Supravalvular aortic stenosis
B. Ventricular septal defect
C. Coarctation of the aorta
D. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. The presence of a sinus venosus atrial septal defect is associated with an increased risk of other congenital anomalies, including right-sided obstructive lesions such as pulmonary valve stenosis or supravalvular aortic stenosis. In this case, the presence of a sinus venosus atrial septal defect would also increase the risk of a left-to-right shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect, which would allow blood to shunt from the left atrium to the right atrium. This would result in an enlarged right atrium and would explain the presence of a sinus venosus atrial septal defect.

He is tangential, jumping from topic to topic, distractible, disorganized, disheveled, and unable to care for himself. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on daily haloperidol. Over the next week, the patient becomes much calmer, sleeps better, and no longer endorses delusions about aliens. The next day, however, he is found by the nursing staff to be confused, sweating, and stiff. His vitals are temperature 103.4 °F (39.6 °C), blood pressure 170/98 mmHg, and heart rate 133 bpm. As a precaution, all medications are stopped. If the patient fails to improve with supportive measures, which of the following medications would be most appropriate to administer?
###Options:
A. Propranolol
B. Atenolol
C. Benztropine
D. Dantolene
E. Cyproheptadine


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Benztropine, which is a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as muscle stiffness and tremors. The patient's symptoms of confusion, sweating, and stiffness are indicative of EPS, likely due to the use of haloperidol. Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic medication that works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. However, it can also cause EPS, which are side effects characterized by muscle rigidity, tremors, and other movement disorders. Benztropine is a medication that can be used to treat EPS, specifically by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. It is important to note that haloperidol is the most effective antipsychotic medication for treating psychosis, but it is also associated with EPS. Therefore, benztropine is often used as a ""rescue"" medication to treat EPS that occur with haloperidol.

Vital signs are temperature 38.9 C (102 F), heart rate 100 bpm, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, coarse crackles are present in the lower lobe of the right lung. A chest x-ray demonstrates an irregular cavity with an air-fluid level in the lateral part of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe of the lung. An elevated white blood cell count is present on the laboratory panel. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the pulmonary finding?
###Options:
A. Hematogenic dissemination from another focus of infection
B. Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions
C. Pulmonary fungal infection
D. Pulmonary tuberculosis
E. sarcoidosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. The clinical presentation of a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level is most consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient's history of alcohol use disorder and the physical examination finding of crackles in the right upper lobe are also suggestive of tuberculosis. Hematogenic dissemination from another focus of infection is less likely in this patient as there is no history of fever or other signs of infection elsewhere in the body. Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions is less likely as there is no mention of altered mental status or oropharyngeal secretions on examination. Pulmonary fungal infection is less likely as there are no risk factors or findings suggestive of immunocompromise. Sarcoidosis is less likely as there are no clinical findings suggestive of this condition such as bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, rash, or systemic symptoms.

###Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of nosebleeds and easy bruisability. His olderbrother has had similar episodes. He is at the 30th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows nasaland gingival bleeding and several ecchymoses over the trunk and upper and lower extremities in various stages ofhealing. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 300,000/mm3 (N=150,000–400,000). Platelet adhesion testingshows a normal response to ristocetin, but aggregation does not occur in response to thrombin; platelet morphology isnormal. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are within the reference ranges. A defect in whichof the following is the most likely cause of the findings in this patient?
###Options:
A. Factor VII (proconvertin)
B. Fibrinogen
C. Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa
D. Granule storage poo

###Question: A 25-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, comes to the office because of a 2-week history of palpitations and heatintolerance. She delivered her child 3 months ago following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. She is breastfeeding. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 54 kg(120 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 106/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressureis 124/68 mm Hg. Examination shows moist palms and bilateral lid lag. No exophthalmos is noted. The thyroid glandis enlarged and nontender. No murmurs are heard on cardiac examination. Deep tendon reflexes are 3 . Serum studiesshow an undetectable TSH concentration, thyroxine (T4) concentration of 20 μg/dL, and triiodothyronine (T3)concentration of 275 ng/dL. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A. Activation of mutations of TSH receptors
B. Increased serum thyroglobulin concentration
C. Ischemic injury to the hypothalamus
D. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid
E. Presence of TSH receptor autoantibodies


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Activation of mutations of TSH receptors. This patient's symptoms of palpitations, heat intolerance, and tachycardia are consistent with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is characterized by elevated levels of circulating thyroid hormones, which can be due to excessive production by the thyroid gland or impaired clearance by the liver. The elevated levels of thyroid hormones lead to increased metabolic rate and result in symptoms such as palpitations and heat intolerance.

Option B: Increased serum thyroxine (T4) concentration. Elevated serum T4 concentration is seen in hyperthyroidism, but it is not the most likely mechanism of this patient's symptoms. Hyperthyroidism is characterized by increased peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to increased levels of both T4 and T3. However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with increased T3 levels rather than T4 levels.

Option C: Ischemic injury to the hypothalamus. This patient's symptoms are not consistent with ischemic injury to the hypothalamus. Ischemic injury to the hypothalamus would typically result in symptoms such as decreased cardiac output, decreased blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, heat intolerance, and tachycardia are not consistent with ischemic injury to the hypothalamus.

Option D: Presence of TSH receptor autoantibodies. This patient's symptoms are most consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of TSH receptor autoantibodies. These autoantibodies stimulate the TSH receptors on the thyroid gland, leading to increased production and release of thyroid hormones. The symptoms of palpitations, heat intolerance, and tachycardia are classic manifestations of hyperthyroidism, which is caused by the overstimulation of the thyroid gland by these autoantibodies.

###Question: A 40-year-old female presents with a visibly enlarged thyroid gland in the neck. She reports symptoms of difficulty swallowing and occasional hoarseness. Laboratory tests reveal normal thyroid hormone levels. Based on these findings, which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Hashimoto's thyroiditis
B. Toxic multinodular goiter
C. Graves' disease
D. Non-toxic multinodular goiter
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D, Non-toxic multinodular goiter. This is a case of a non-toxic multinodular goiter, which is a common condition in adults. The enlarged thyroid gland is likely a result of the accumulation of non-cancerous thyroid cells. This condition is often benign and asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing and hoarseness if the gland becomes large enough to press on surrounding structures. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition that can cause hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland. However, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient's thyroid hormone levels are normal. Toxic multinodular goiter is a rare condition characterized by the production of thyroid hormones by the enlarged gland. However, the patient's thyroid hormone levels are normal, making this option less likely. Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition that causes hyperthyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland. However, the patient's thyroid hormone levels are normal, making this option less likely. N/A is not applicable, as there is information provided in the question stem that allows for the exclusion of certain diagnoses.

A. Investigation is not required if the baby is breast fed and otherwise well
B. A high conjugated bilirubin is typical of breast milk jaundice
C. The baby's faeces should be pale, grey/white in breast milk jaundice
D. Parents should be advised to change to formula milk feeds
E. Jaundice can persist beyond 2 months of age


### Response: The correct answer is"," option 4, Jaundice can persist beyond 2 months of age. Breast milk jaundice is a benign condition that usually resolves by itself without any specific treatment. It is a common condition and usually occurs between 2 and 6 weeks of age. It is due to the presence of unconjugated bilirubin in breast milk. The level of bilirubin in breast milk is usually less than 15 mg/100 ml. The level of bilirubin in the serum of breast fed babies is usually less than 1 mg/100 ml. The level of bilirubin in the serum of formula fed babies is usually less than 2 mg/100 ml. Breast milk jaundice is not due to the presence of conjugated bilirubin in breast milk. The level of conjugated bilirubin in breast milk is usually less than 1 mg/100 ml. The level of conjugated bilirubin in the serum of breast fed babies is usually less than 0.2 mg/100 ml. The level of conjugated bilirubin in the serum of formula fed babies is usually less than 0.3 mg/100 ml. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition

###Question: A 17-year-old college student requests advice about influenza vaccination. He mentioned an episode of muscle weakness in the past, from which he recovered completely. There is no family history of muscle diseases. On examination, neurological examination was normal. He had a systolic murmur signifying a valvular disorder under a cardiologist's care. Evaluation of other systems was within normal limits. How should the patient be advised?
###Options:
A. A thorough cardiac evaluation is necessary before vaccination
B. The nasal influenza vaccine is indicated
C. The influenza vaccine is contraindicated due to his previous history of muscle weakness
D. Routine vaccination can be given safely
E. Routine vaccination can't be given safely


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Routine vaccination can be given safely. The patient in question is presenting with a history of muscle weakness, which has completely resolved. There is no family history of muscle diseases. The cardiac evaluation has shown a systolic murmur, which is a benign finding. The patient is under the care of a cardiologist and is asymptomatic. Hence, there is no need to delay vaccination due to a cardiac evaluation. The influenza vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine and is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals. The patient is immunocompetent and hence there is no contraindication for influenza vaccination.

###Options:
A. Continued observation
B. Endometrial biopsy
C. Cervical conization
D. Hysterectomy
E. Pelvic ultrasonography


### Response: The correct answer is"," A, continued observation. This patient has a uterus that is larger than expected for her age and is irregular in shape. These findings are suspicious for a uterine neoplasm. The patient should be observed with repeat pelvic examinations and possibly curettage. Endometrial biopsy would not be helpful because the uterine size is abnormal. Cervical conization would not be indicated because the patient has an irregular uterus.

###Options:
A. The head of the humerus
B. The rotator cuff
C. Common extensor origin
D. The sternoclavicular joint
E. The acromioclavicular joint


### Response: The correct answer is"," B: the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is a fibrous sheath of muscles and their tendons that connect the upper arm bone (humerus) to the shoulder blade (scapula). The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles form this cuff. The cuff provides stability to the shoulder joint and prevents dislocation. Injury to the rotator cuff is a common cause of shoulder pain. The head of the humerus is the other possible answer, but it is not the most common site of injury. The common extensor origin is not a lump on the shoulder. The sternoclavicular joint is not the correct answer either. The acromioclavicular joint is not the correct answer either.

###Question: A 3-year-old boy has been referred to paediatric admissions by his GP. His parents have noticed him limping when walking around the house for the past 2 days. There is no distress when sat, but has complained of pain. Parents deny any trauma. When further history taken, he has had a recent cold. On exam, patient is well, but there is decreased range of movement in the hip.
###Options:
A. Septic Arthritis
B. Transient Synovitis
C. Perthes Disease
D. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
E. Henoch-Schonlein Purpura


### Response: The correct answer is"," B (Transient Synovitis): Transient Synovitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Transient Synovitis Transient synovitis is the most common cause of hip pain in children. It is a self-limiting condition, and is characterised by inflammation of the synovium of the hip joint. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other causes of hip pain must be ruled out. The condition typically affects children aged 2-6 years, and is more common in boys. The child presents with hip pain and limp. The pain is usually described as a pulling feeling, and is worse with movement. The child may have had a viral illness recently. On examination, there may be some mild tenderness on palpation of the hip, but it is not always present. The range of movement is usually normal, and there is no joint effusion. The child is usually well, and the condition is self-limiting, with resolution occurring within 1-2 weeks. Treatment is usually conservative, with bed rest, analgesia and possibly anti-inflammatory medication. Surgery is rarely required, and is usually reserved for cases that have lasted longer than 3-4 weeks. Septic Arthritis Septic arthritis is a serious condition, and requires urgent investigation and treatment. It is the most serious of the conditions listed in the question stem, and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of transient synovitis. Septic arthritis is a bacterial infection of the joint, and is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The child presents with a high temperature, and there may be systemic features of infection such as vomiting and poor appetite. On examination, there may be localised tenderness and swelling over the joint. The child is usually unwell, and may have a reduced level of consciousness. The joint may be visibly swollen, and there may be joint effusion. The child should be treated with intravenous antibiotics, and the joint aspirated to confirm the diagnosis. The joint should be irrigated, and if purulent material is seen, the joint should be drained. The child should be admitted to hospital for intravenous antibiotics and close observation. The condition is usually self-limiting, and resolution occurs within 2-3 weeks. Perthes Disease Perthes disease is a condition that affects the femoral head, and is most commonly seen in boys aged 5-8 years. It is caused by avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The child presents with pain in the hip, and may have a limp. The child is usually well, and there may be no systemic features of infection. On examination, there may be tenderness and mild swelling over the hip. The child may have a positive Trendelenburg test, and the limb may be slightly shortened. The child should be admitted to hospital for observation and further investigations. The condition is usually self-limiting, and resolution occurs within 6-12 months. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the joints. It is the most common rheumatological disease in children. The child presents with joint pain and swelling. The joints may be warm, and there may be systemic features of infection such as fever and malaise. On examination, there may be joint effusion, and the child may have a limp. JIA affects the joints symmetrically, and the knees, ankles and feet are most commonly affected. The child is usually well, and there is no evidence of systemic illness. The condition is usually self-limiting, and resolution occurs within 6-12 months.

### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Mitral stenosis and tricuspid regurgitation. The findings of a loud first heart sound, a diastolic rumble, and a large v wave in the jugular pulse are all consistent with the presence of mitral stenosis. Tricuspid regurgitation would be associated with a prominent x descent of the jugular pulse waveform.

The symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and fever are consistent with pneumonia. The crackles on pulmonary examination are also consistent with pneumonia. The most likely cause of disease in this patient is acute Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Pneumocystis jiroveci is a fungus that is commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals. However, in immunocompromised individuals, it can cause a severe pneumonia. This patient likely developed the infection after spending time in a relatively unventilated, humid environment. The patient likely did not develop influenza from close contact with the other members of the caving expedition because the symptoms of influenza typically include fever, cough, and sore throat, and the physical examination would likely reveal rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and conjunctivitis. The patient likely did not have disseminated aspergillosis because the symptoms of aspergillosis include fever, cough, and dyspnea, but the physical examination would likely reveal a rash or skin lesions. The patient likely did not have miliary tuberculosis because the symptoms of miliary tuberculosis include fever, cough, and dyspnea, but the physical examination would likely reveal hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and rash. The patient likely did not have acute pulmonary histoplasmosis because the symptoms of histoplasmosis include fever, cough, and dyspnea, but the physical examination would likely reveal hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and rash.

You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries. Answer with the best option directly, followed by the rationale for the selected option.

### Input:
###Question: A 43-year-old woman complains of low energy, cold intolerance, and constipation. She further adds that she has gained 10 lbs (4.5 kg) over a short period. The provider suspects that she has hypothyroidism. Further laboratory workup revealed a T4 of 0.3 ng/dL (normal range 0.4 to 1.7 nanograms per deciliter) and a TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) of 12 mU/L (normal range 0.4 to 4.0 milli-international units per liter). The patient is started on levothyroxine 100 mcg/day. Which of the following hormones is measured to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine?
###Options:
A. Free T4 levels
B. Free T3 Levels
C. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
D. Total T3 levels
E. albumin level


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C TSH. TSH is a hormone that is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T4 and T3 are then released into the bloodstream. TSH levels are regulated by a negative feedback loop. When T4 levels are low, TSH levels increase, and when T4 levels are high, TSH levels decrease. Therefore, TSH levels are measured to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine. Free T4 levels are not measured because they are not used to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine. Free T3 levels are not measured because they are not used to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine. Total T3 levels are not measured because they are not used to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine. Albumin levels are not used to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine. Albumin is used to determine the level of thyroxine (T4) in the blood.

### Input:
###Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 1-year history of intermittent abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. She reports a history of consuming contaminated drinking water. On examination, she has a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Colon cancer
B. Crohn's disease
C. Tuberculosis
D. Amoebiasis
E. Diverticulitis


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Amoebiasis. This is a case of amebiasis, which is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, along with a history of consuming contaminated drinking water, are classic for amebiasis. The presence of a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen is indicative of an intra-abdominal abscess, which is a common complication of amebiasis.

Option A: Colon cancer: Colon cancer typically presents with symptoms such as rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits, and weight loss. While weight loss is present in this patient, the history of consuming contaminated drinking water and the presence of a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen are not consistent with colon cancer.

Option B: Crohn's disease: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. However, the history of consuming contaminated drinking water and the presence of a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen are not typical for Crohn's disease.

Option C: Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While it can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain and weight loss, the history of consuming contaminated drinking water and the presence of a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen are not consistent with tuberculosis.

Option E: Diverticulitis: Diverticulitis is a condition characterized by inflammation or infection of diverticula, which are small pouches that can form in the colon. While it can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, the history of consuming contaminated drinking water and the presence of a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen are not consistent with diverticulitis.

### Input:
###Question: A 25-year-old woman undergoes a cesarean section due to failure of fetal descent. During labor the previous morning, she had made no progress despite pushing for 3 hours and eventually delivered via cesarean section. Her immediate recovery was uncomplicated, and she was transferred to the postpartum floor. Overnight, the postpartum nurse called to report low urine output. An intravenous fluid bolus was ordered with only minimal response. The nurse called again, this time to report hematuria in the catheter bag. She flushed the catheter with saline, but the hematuria persisted. In the morning, on physical examination, the patient has suprapubic tenderness, and her abdomen is moderately distended. Hematuria is again noted. Which of the following techniques during the cesarean section might have decreased the risk of this complication?
###Options:
A. A Pfannensteil skin incision
B. Creation of a bladder flap
C. Double-layer closure of the hysterotomy
D. Closure of the subcutaneous space
E. none


### Response: The correct answer is"," c (double-layer closure of the hysterotomy). The patient has a classical cesarean hysterotomy scar, which has resulted in a bladder fistula. This complication is not uncommon, occurring in 1% of all cesarean sections. The fistula is usually an iatrogenic complication of the cesarean section, resulting from a poorly sutured hysterotomy. The hysterotomy is a transverse incision through the uterus, extending from the pubic bones to the upper border of the symphysis pubis. The bladder is in close proximity to the lower uterine segment, and a small amount of urine may leak from the bladder into the lower uterine segment during the hysterotomy closure. This can lead to a small tract between the bladder and the lower uterine segment. If this tract is not closed properly, urine can collect in the space between the bladder and the uterus, leading to a bladder fistula. The Pfannensteil incision is a vertical skin incision that extends from the pubic bones to the umbilicus. This incision is not associated with a hysterotomy and would not have decreased the risk of bladder fistula formation in this case. The creation of a bladder flap is a technique used in radical pelvic surgery to allow for the resection of a tumor while preserving continence. This technique is not relevant to the prevention of bladder fistula formation after a cesarean section. The double-layer closure of the hysterotomy is a technique that has been shown to decrease the incidence of bladder fistula formation after a cesarean section. The closure of the subcutaneous space would not have decreased the risk of bladder fistula formation in this case.

###Question: A 65-year-old woman presents via EMS with abdominal pain and weakness. The pain began 7 hours ago and is associated with nausea and vomiting. She underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any complications for symptomatic gallstones a month ago. Her medical history includes hypertension and lactose intolerance. She is currently taking lisinopril and some herbal supplements. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or any illicit drugs. She received 1 L of normal saline on the way to the hospital. Her vital signs are temperature 102 °F (39 °C ), heart rate 119 bpm, blood pressure 78/56 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. On physical examination, she has icteric sclera and dry mucous membranes. There is right upper quadrant tenderness without rebound tenderness. The heart and lungs are clear on auscultation. She is confused. Laboratory test results are WBC count 17,000/mm3, total bilirubin 7.2 mg/dL, ALT 131 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 640 U/L. Abdominal ultrasound shows bile duct dilatation.

E. Physiotherapy


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Intramuscular depot injection of methylprednisolone plus NSAIDs and methotrexate and sulfasalazine. This patient has early rheumatoid arthritis, which is characterised by soft tissue swelling and joint effusions. The presence of rheumatoid factor is not a reason to delay treatment. The first-line treatment for early rheumatoid arthritis is a combination of methotrexate and sulfasalazine with or without NSAIDs. This is an effective treatment that can halt the progression of joint damage. If the patient does not respond to this treatment, or if the disease is very active, then a combination of a biological DMARD (eg, anti-TNF therapy) and methotrexate is recommended. If the patient is not responding to this treatment, then a coicosteroid injection may be used. Coicosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects and can provide rapid relief of symptoms. However, they should only be used in the short term and, if used, should be combined with methotrexate. Physiotherapy is an important part of the treatment, and can help to maintain joint mobility.

###Question:  A 40-year-old African patient presents with a history of chronic shoulder pain and stiffness, worse at night and with overhead activities. Physical examination reveals limited range of motion, particularly in external rotation. Imaging reveals narrowing of the subacromial space and osteophyte formation. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?
###Options:
A. Rotator cuff tear
B. Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)
C. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis
D. Shoulder impingement syndrome
E. Acromioclavicular joint arthritis


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. The patient has symptoms of impingement syndrome, which is caused by mechanical compression of the rotator cuff tendons as they pass through the coracoacromial arch. The subacromial space is a narrow passageway just beneath the acromion process of the scapula. Inflammation and osteophyte formation can narrow this space, causing impingement of the rotator cuff tendons.

###Question: A 9-month-old male from Central America is brought to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of intermittent, inconsolable crying and hugging his knees to his abdomen. He has had two bloody stools and vomiting. The infant is irritable with a temperature of 38.5 C. The abdomen seems tender, and the child continues crying. What is the best initial diagnostic test?
###Options:
A. Stool for giardia antigen, ova, and parasites
B. Air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view
C. Abdominal ultrasound
D. Plain radiograph of the abdomen
E. CT scan


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: Air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view. This is a case of intussusception, which is the telescoping of one segment of bowel into another. It is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in children between the ages of 3 and 9 months. The classic presentation includes intermittent, inconsolable crying, tenderness on examination, and bloody stools. The diagnosis is often made with an air contrast enema, which is a minimally invasive and effective diagnostic test. The air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view is the best initial test because it can both confirm the diagnosis and assess for the presence of ischemic bowel. The other tests listed are not the best initial tests for this patient. Stool for giardia antigen, ova, and parasites is not indicated in this patient. Stool for ova and parasites is used to evaluate for infectious causes of diarrhea, such as giardia or amoeba, but it would not be helpful in this case. Stool for C. difficile is used to evaluate for pseudomembranous colitis, which is a bacterial infection of the colon that can cause diarrhea. It is not the best initial test for this patient because it does not provide immediate results and would not help guide immediate management. Abdominal ultrasound is a good test to evaluate for intussusception, but it is not the best initial test because it is an invasive test and requires trained personnel to perform and interpret the results. Plain radiograph of the abdomen is not the best initial test because it is an invasive test and requires exposure to radiation. CT scan is not the best initial test because it is an invasive test and requires contrast dye, which may not be necessary in this case.

###Question: A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents with a 2-day history of sudden onset of severe chest pain. Electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. What is the most likely diagnosis? 
###Options:
A. Acute myocardial infarction
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Aortic dissection
D. Pericarditis
E. Myocarditis


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Acute myocardial infarction. The patient's clinical presentation, with severe chest pain and ST-segment elevation on the ECG, is most consistent with acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is characterized by occlusion of a coronary aery, leading to ischemic damage to the myocardium. The anterior wall of the left ventricle is most susceptible to ischemic damage because it receives blood from the left anterior descending coronary aery, which is the most commonly occluded coronary aery. The other choices are less likely based on the patient's presentation. Pulmonary embolism typically presents with sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Aortic dissection typically presents with sudden onset of tearing, ripping, or splitting chest pain that may radiate to the back, abdomen, or extremities. Pericarditis typically presents with sharp, stabbing chest pain that may be exacerbated by lying flat or coughing. Myocarditis typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weakness, and may be associated with a viral illness.

Serotonin is a vasoactive amine that causes vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to the symptoms of diarrhea and weight loss. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that inhibits the release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances, thereby controlling the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Rifaxamine is an antibiotic that is used to treat Helicobacter pylori infection. It is not indicated in the treatment of carcinoid syndrome. Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that decreases the release of norepinephrine, thereby decreasing blood pressure. It is not indicated in the treatment of carcinoid syndrome. Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant that binds bile acids in the intestine, thereby preventing their reabsorption. It is not indicated in the treatment of carcinoid syndrome. Lomotil is a medication that contains diphenoxylate, an opioid, and atropine sulfate, an anticholinergic.

###Options:
A. Repeated MRI of the head
B. Cognitive behavioral therapy
C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Borrelia burgdorferi
D. Lumbar puncture and cerebral fluid analysis
E. Switch from nortriptyline to venlafaxine


### Response: The correct answer is"," B: Cognitive behavioral therapy. This patient's symptoms are suggestive of a somatization disorder, which is characterized by multiple physical complaints that persist for more than 6 months and are not explained by another medical condition.

The evaluation thus far has been unrevealing, and the patient is seeking a second opinion. The most appropriate management option is cognitive behavioral therapy, which has been shown to be effective in treating somatization disorder.

###Options:
A. Hemolytic reaction
B. Allergic reaction
C. Febrile non-hemolytic reaction
D. Delayed hemolytic reaction
E. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)


### Response: The correct answer is"," delayed hemolytic reaction. Delayed hemolytic reactions are immune-mediated reactions to transfused blood products that occur days to weeks after the transfusion. The reactions are caused by the presence of antibodies in the transfused blood product that are directed against antigens on the red blood cells of the recipient. The antibodies cause the red blood cells in the transfused blood product to lyse (break down) over time, leading to a decrease in the number of circulating red blood cells. The antibodies can be present in the recipient's blood before the transfusion or can be produced by the recipient's immune system after the transfusion.

###Question: An 80-year-old man presents with fatigue for the past month and a recent episode of hematochezia. His wife adds that he gets tired and short of breath more quickly than usual and is starting to look pale. A physical examination reveals a pale older male with no significant findings. A complete blood count shows a microcytic anemia. A fecal occult blood test is positive. A lower gastrointestinal bleed is suspected. Other than colonoscopy, what diagnostic measure can be used to localize a lower gastrointestinal bleed?
###Options:
A. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
B. MRI of the abdomen
C. X-ray of the abdomen
D. Technetium-99m red blood cell labeled scintigraphy
E. CT of the abdomen


### Response: The correct answer is"," technetium-99m red blood cell labeled scintigraphy. This nuclear medicine test is used to localize the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is based on the principle that free technetium-99m will not localize in the gastrointestinal tract, but technetium-99m labeled red blood cells will localize in the area of bleeding. The patient is injected with technetium-99m labeled red blood cells and a gamma camera is used to detect the area of bleeding. This test is useful in localizing obscure bleeding, where the bleeding site is not easily identified by physical examination or endoscopy. This test is also useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, such as in this patient with occult blood in the stool. The other tests listed are not used for localization of bleeding.

A. Cardiogenic shock
B. Cardiogenic shock
C. Septic (distributive) shock
D. Anaphylactic shock
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Cardiogenicshock. The patient's hypotension is most likely due to cardiacdecompensation, as suggested by the elevated PCWP and the lowCVP and PA.

###Question: A 12-year-old girl with a childhood history of asthma complained of cough, dyspnea, and wheezing after visiting a riding stable. Her symptoms became so severe that her parents brought her to the emergency room. Which of the following is the most appropriate drug to rapidly reverse her bronchoconstriction?
###Options:
A. Inhaled fluticasone
B. Inhaled beclomethasone
C. Inhaled albuterol
D. Intravenous propranolol
E. Oral theophylline


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Inhaled albuterol. The patient's symptoms are consistent with an acute asthma attack, which is a medical emergency. Albuterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist that acts rapidly to relax bronchial smooth muscle, improve gas exchange, and relieve dyspnea and wheezing. It is the drug of choice for the treatment of acute asthma attacks in children. Inhaled corticosteroids such as fluticasone and beclomethasone are used to reduce bronchial inflammation and prevent asthma attacks, but they do not have the same rapid bronchodilator effect. Inhaled theophylline is also used to prevent asthma attacks, but it does not have the same rapid bronchodilator effect as albuterol. Intravenous beta-2 adrenergic agonists such as salbutamol are not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma attacks.

###Question: A 3-week-old girl delivered at term with no complications is brought to the physician by her mother because of a 1-week history of yellow eyes and skin, tan-colored stools, and dark brown urine. The newborn has been breast-feeding without difficulty. She is alert and appears to be in no distress. She is at the 50th percentile for length and weight. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There is mild hepatomegaly; the spleen is not palpable. Laboratory studies show:Hemoglobin 14.4 g/dLHematocrit 43%Leukocyte count 8000/mm3SerumAlbumin 3.5 g/dLBilirubin, total 14 mg/dL Direct 12.5 mg/dLAST 50 U/LALT 45 U/LWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Biliary atresia
B. Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type I
C. Gilbert syndrome
D. Hemolytic disease of the newborn
E. Physiologic jaundice


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. Physiologic jaundice. The newborn's clinical picture is consistent with physiologic jaundice, which is a benign condition seen in healthy term infants characterized by elevated bilirubin levels without signs of illness. Physiologic jaundice is a result of immaturity of the neonatal liver, which is unable to conjugate bilirubin efficiently. The peak bilirubin level is usually reached around 3-5 days of life and resolves spontaneously by 1 week of age. The bilirubin level in this case is within the normal range, and there are no signs of illness. Biliary atresia is a condition in which there is obliteration of the extrahepatic biliary system, leading to bile accumulation and subsequent liver damage. Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type I, is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the inability to synthesize bilirubin glucuronoside. This results in the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, which can lead to kernicterus. Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Hemolytic disease of the newborn is a condition in which there is destruction of red blood cells, leading to anemia.

### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A. Total Lung Capacity (TLC) is a measure of the maximum volume of air in the lungs after a maximal inspiration. TLC is comprised of Vital Capacity (VC) and Inspiratory Capacity (IC). VC measures the volume of air that can be exhaled after a maximal inspiration. IC measures the volume of air that can be inhaled after a maximal exhalation. TLC is decreased in Restrictive Lung Disease. In this type of lung disease, the lungs have a decreased ability to expand and fill with air. This results in a decreased VC and IC.

###Question: A 17-year-old boy presents with a right-hand tremor, personality changes, and a random jerking of his right leg for the past 3 weeks. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 1. His family history is significant for a brain tumor in his father. His diet includes significant consumption of mushrooms, chocolate, liver, and shellfish. His current medications include multivitamins. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated liver enzymes. The eye examination shows a ring that appears like brown rust in the Descemet membrane of the cornea. The diagnosis is established using blood and urine tests, and appropriate treatment is initiated. Which of the following is a risk factor for the underlying condition in this patient?
###Options:
A. Diabetes mellitus type 1
B. Male sex
C. His diet
D. Brain tumor in his father
E. Diabetes mellitus type 2


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, his diet. This patient's tremor, personality changes, and random jerking of his right leg are all consistent with a diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective copper homeostasis, leading to copper toxicity and subsequent damage to the liver, brain, and other organs. The underlying condition in this patient is a defect in the ATP7B gene, which leads to impaired copper excretion into bile and subsequent copper accumulation in the liver. The liver is the primary site of copper storage, and excessive copper can lead to liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma. The classic neurologic symptoms of Wilson's disease include tremor, dystonia, and chorea. Personality changes are also common. The eye findings of this patient, including the brown rust-like ring in the Descemet membrane of the cornea, are known as Kayser-Fleischer rings. Kayser-Fleischer rings are indicative of Wilson's disease and are caused by copper deposition in Descemet membrane of the cornea.

His history is remarkable for seasonal allergies, and the only medication he uses is a nasal corticosteroid in the fall. The physical examination, including vital signs, is normal, exception for the skin examination, shown in Figure- Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?
###Options:
A. Topical corticosteroids
B. Topical tacrolimus
C. Oral antibiotics
D. Topical antifungals
E. Oral corticosteroids


### Response: The correct answer is"," option A topical corticosteroids. This patient's symptoms are suggestive of chronic hand dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dryness, itching, and redness of the skin on the hands and fingers. The most common cause of chronic hand dermatitis is irritant contact dermatitis, which occurs when the skin is exposed to irritants such as detergents, disinfectants, and soaps. The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic hand dermatitis, as he has a history of seasonal allergies and is using only a nasal corticosteroid, which is not a typical cause of chronic hand dermatitis. The physical examination shows skin that is dry and scaly, which is characteristic of chronic hand dermatitis. The most appropriate treatment for chronic hand dermatitis is the use of topical corticosteroids, which help to reduce inflammation and itching. Topical corticosteroids are considered first-line treatment for chronic hand dermatitis, and they have been shown to be effective in treating this condition. Other treatments for chronic hand dermatitis include topical tacrolimus, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids. However, these treatments are typically reserved for more severe cases that do not respond to topical corticosteroids. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is topical corticosteroids, and the most effective treatment is a daily moisturizer in addition to topical corticosteroids.

###Question: In patients with a facial nerve paralysis, all of the following characteristics may be present except:
###Options:
A. Eyebrow ptosis
B. Blepharoptosis
C. Lower eyelid ectropion
D. Epiphora
E. Ocular exposure symptoms


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Epiphora was not mentioned as a possible finding in patients with facial nerve paralysis. Epiphora is the accumulation of tears in the conjunctival sac, which results from either excessive tear secretion or impaired drainage of the tear film. The facial nerve innervates the muscles of facial expression, including the orbicularis oculi, which is responsible for blinking and eyelid closure. In patients with facial nerve paralysis, there is a loss of tone in the orbicularis oculi muscle, which results in incomplete eyelid closure. This can lead to exposure of the eye to the environment, which can result in ocular exposure symptoms. The other findings listed in the question are all associated with facial nerve paralysis.

His medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder and hypertension. Family history is insignificant. The physical examination demonstrates hand flapping when his arms are outstretched. Lactulose has been ineffective. What is the best next step in treatment?
###Options:
A. Rifaximin
B. Pantoprazole
C. Vitamin B12
D. Hydroxyurea
E. rifampicin


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Rifaximin. The patient's presentation is suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that occurs due to liver dysfunction. The most common precipitating factor is alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's symptoms of hand flapping (indicative of ataxia) and sleepiness (indicative of sedation) are classic for hepatic encephalopathy. The next step in treatment is to treat the underlying liver disease. Rifaximin is an effective treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. It is a non-absorbed oral antibiotic that reduces the production of ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and prevent gastric ulcers. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not associated with hand flapping. Hydroxyurea is used in the treatment of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis.

###Question: A 25-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a chronic cough, fever, and weight loss. She also reports night sweats and fatigue. A chest X-ray reveals mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?
###Options:
A. Lung cancer
B. Pneumonia
C. Histoplasmosis
D. Sarcoidosis
E. Tuberculosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. Tuberculosis:

The patient's symptoms of chronic cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss, along with the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray, are highly suggestive of tuberculosis. The most common extrapulmonary site of tuberculosis is lymph nodes, which is evident in this case. The symptoms of tuberculosis are nonspecific and can mimic many other diseases, making it a diagnostic challenge. The gold standard for diagnosis is a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli.

Lung cancer is less likely in this patient as there is no history of smoking and the chest X-ray does not show the typical findings of lung cancer such as a mass or nodule. Pneumonia can present with fever and cough, but it is less likely in this patient as there is no consolidation on the chest X-ray. Histoplasmosis can present with symptoms similar to tuberculosis, but the chest X-ray findings are not consistent with histoplasmosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that can present with symptoms similar to tuberculosis, but the chest X-ray findings are not consistent with sarcoidosis.

B. Conjunctival inflammation and severe sicca are the main features
C. Cicatrical lagophthalmos can occur
D. Aggressive lubrication is adequate even in severe cases of GVHD
E. All of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," 'd' i.e. Aggressive lubrication is adequate even in severe cases of GVHD. GVHD is a relatively common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. It is caused by the grafted cells (foreign bone marrow cells) attacking the patient's tissues. The main clinical features are conjunctival inflammation and severe sicca (dryness of mouth and eyes). Cicatrical lagophthalmos (a condition in which the eyelids are permanently closed) can occur. In severe cases, the eyelids may be adherent and the cornea may be involved. The condition is usually accompanied by severe dryness of the mouth and eyes. The treatment of choice is lubricating drops and ointments. In mild cases, lubricating drops may be sufficient. In severe cases, lubricating ointments are required to prevent corneal damage.

###Options:
A. Serum protein electrophoresis
B. Colonoscopy
C. Echocardiography
D. Bone scan
E. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Colonoscopy. This patient's chronic low back pain, fatigue, and weight loss, along with the presence of anemia, are suggestive of a gastrointestinal malignancy, specifically a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are rare tumors that can be found anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, including the small intestine, stomach, colon, and rectum. They are most commonly found in the stomach (60%), small intestine (25%), and colon (15%). They are typically asymptomatic unless they become large or ulcerate. Symptoms that do occur can include abdominal pain, fullness, nausea, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux. Weight loss can occur due to the chronic anemia associated with GISTs. The patient's chronic low back pain is likely due to compression of the lumbar spine from the mass. The patient's fatigue is likely due to the anemia and chronic pain. The patient's hypochlorhydria is likely due to the GIST-induced gastritis. The patient's mildly decreased appetite is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly decreased red blood cell count and hemoglobin level are likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is likely due to the anemia. The patient's increased red cell distribution width (RDW) is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased urea nitrogen is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly decreased creatinine level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly decreased albumin level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased calcium level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased alkaline phosphatase level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased lactate dehydrogenase level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased carcinoembryonic antigen level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased cancer antigen 19-9 level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased cancer antigen 72-4 level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased carbohydrate antigen 125 level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased prolactin level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased prothrombin time is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased total bilirubin level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased alanine aminotransferase level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased aspartate aminotransferase level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased lactate dehydrogenase level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased creatine kinase level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased uric acid level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased urea nitrogen level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased uric acid level is likely due to the anemia. The patient's mildly increased white blood cell count is likely due to the anemia.

The next step in the diagnosis of this patient's condition is colonoscopy. Colonoscopy will help determine the extent of the GIST and whether it is causing the patient's symptoms. The patient's chronic low back pain, fatigue, and weight loss are all symptoms that can be associated with a GIST. A GIST is a rare tumor that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. GISTs are usually asymptomatic unless they become large or ulcerate. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, fullness, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. GISTs can also cause symptoms due to the release of vaso"

###Options:
A. 11-hydroxylase
B. 12-hydroxylase
C. 11-beta-hydroxylase

###Question: A 3-day-old female newborn is brought to the hospital because of a yellowish, milky fluid leaking from both nipples. She was delivered at term to a 20-year-old woman. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Examination of the newborn is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following hormones is the most likely cause of this finding?
###Options:
A. Maternal estrogen
B. Maternal progesterone
C. Maternal prolactin
D. Newborn estrogen
E. Newborn progesterone


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Maternal prolactin, so the analysis is:

Prolactin is a hormone that stimulates the production of milk in the breast. During pregnancy, prolactin levels increase to promote milk production. After delivery, prolactin levels decrease, but if the baby is nursing, it can stimulate milk production in the mother's breasts. This can lead to the yellowish, milky fluid seen in the nipples.

Estrogen is a hormone that is produced in the ovaries and is responsible for promoting the growth of the uterus and breast tissue during pregnancy. However, it is not the most likely cause of the described finding in this case. Estrogen levels are already low in the postpartum period, so it is unlikely to cause the leakage of milk from the nipples.

Progesterone is a hormone that is produced in the ovaries and is responsible for maintaining a healthy pregnancy. It is also responsible for promoting the growth of the uterus and breast tissue during pregnancy. However, it is not the most likely cause of the described finding in this case. Progesterone levels are already low in the postpartum period, so it is unlikely to cause the leakage of milk from the nipples.

However, it is not the most likely cause of the described finding in this case. Estrogen levels are already low in the postpartum period, so it is unlikely to cause the leakage of milk from the nipples.

Prolactin is a hormone that is produced in the pituitary gland and is responsible for stimulating the production of milk in the breasts.

###Question: A 24-year-old male presents with sore throat, subjective fever, abdominal pain, and bad breath. He says that a neighbor’s child is currently being treated for strep throat. On examination, his temperature is 101.1°F and his other vital signs are normal. He appears well. His throat is erythematous and his tonsils are enlarged, but there are no pharyngeal or tonsillar exudates. He has no cervical adenopathy. He has an occasional cough but his lungs are clear. His abdominal examination is normal.  The presence of which of the following findings is a clinical predictor for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis?
###Options:
A. Erythematous tonsils
B. cough
C. Tonsilar exudates
D. Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy
E. halitosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C: Tonsilar exudates. Tonsillar exudates are a clinical predictor for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Tonsillar exudates are not a manifestation of the disease itself, but rather a response to the infection. They are a sign that the infection is likely to be caused by a bacteria, specifically group A Streptococcus.

###Question: A 65-year-old man with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation and medial compartment osteoarthritis of the left knee presents with pain in both lower legs that is exacerbated with walking. The patient was instructed to discontinue warfarin prior to a unilateral total knee arthroplasty 2 weeks ago. The patient was discharged on the same day of the surgery. He resumed his warfarin 3 days after surgery. His postoperative recovery has been uneventful so far. He began physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening 2 days ago. His symptoms are relieved with sitting. On physical examination, his peripheral pulses and sensation to light touch are intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
###Options:
A. Spinal stenosis
B. Claudication
C. Dissecting aortic aneurysm
D. Deep venous thrombosis
E. none


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT). This patient's presentation of bilateral lower extremity pain that is exacerbated with walking and relieved with sitting is consistent with DVT. The patient's recent surgery, recent discontinuation of warfarin, and the initiation of physical therapy are all risk factors for DVT. The patient's symptoms are also relieved with sitting, which is a common position used to compress the common femoral vein and aid in the treatment of DVT. The patient's peripheral pulses and sensation to light touch are intact, indicating that there is no vascular compromise to the lower extremities. Spinal stenosis typically presents with back and radicular pain, and is unlikely to be exacerbated by walking or relieved by sitting. Claudication is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease, and is unlikely to be bilateral. A dissecting aortic aneurysm typically presents with sudden, severe, tearing, or pulsatile pain in the chest or back, and is unlikely to be relieved by sitting.

###Question: A 24-year-old African-American woman with no cardiac history is referred to your clinic for furtherevaluation of shortness of breath. She had twins 2 months ago and states that she did fine afterdelivery. Since then, she has noticed progressive shortness of breath with mild exertion, the need for3 pillows to sleep at night, as well as increased lower extremity swelling. On physical examination, herblood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, pulse is 95 beats per minute, respiration rate is 20 breaths perminute, and she has oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. She has evidence of jugular venousdistention; normal S1, S2; and an S3 is heard on cardiac examination. She has bibasilar crackles andlower extremity edema.Which of the following is the next appropriate step in the management of this patient?
###Options:
A. Order STAT chest computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the patient for pulmonary embolism and start heparin
B. Evaluate the patient for any identifiable causes for heart failure, order an echocardiogram, and start afterload reduction
C. Refer the patient for an echocardiogram to evaluate for pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology
D. Reassure the patient that she is just anxious and start her on a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
E. Refer the patient for a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for constrictive or restrictive physiology


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B, Evaluate the patient for an echocardiogram, and start afterload reduction.The patient's presentation of shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and evidence of jugular venous distention, along with the absence of S3 and crackles, is suggestive of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The most common cause of HFpEF is increased afterload, which can be seen in conditions such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, and obesity. The patient's twin pregnancy and delivery could have led to increased blood volume and subsequently increased cardiac afterload. The symptoms of HFpEF can mimic those of pulmonary embolism, but the patient's clinical presentation and examination findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is 93%, which is within the normal range. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath with mild exertion, lower extremity swelling, and evidence of jugular venous distention are suggestive of fluid overload, which is not typically seen in pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the next appropriate step in the management of this patient is to evaluate her for any identifiable causes for heart failure, order an echocardiogram, and start afterload reduction.

###Options:
A. Past history of pelvic inflammatory disease
B. Past history of cervical cancer
C. Past history of osteoporosis
D. Past history of thromboembolism

### Input:
###Question: Men who take large doses of testosterone-like androgenic steroids for long periods are sterile in the reproductive sense of the word. What is the explanation for this finding?
###Options:
A. High levels of androgens bind to testosterone receptors in the Sertoli cells, resulting in overstimulation of inhibin formation
B. Overstimulation of sperm cell production results in the formation of defective sperm cells
C. High levels of androgen compounds inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus, resulting in the inhibition of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone release by the anterior pituitary
D. High levels of androgen compounds produce hypertrophic dysfunction of the prostate gland
E. None of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: High levels of androgens bind to testosterone receptors in the Sertoli cells, resulting in overstimulation of inhibin formation. The Sertoli cells are specialized cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testes that nourish developing sperm cells. The secretion of inhibin by the Sertoli cells is essential for normal sperm cell development. High levels of androgens, such as those produced by exogenous testosterone administration, can saturate the androgen receptors in the Sertoli cells, resulting in overstimulation of inhibin production. Overstimulation of inhibin production leads to a decrease in the number of sperm cells produced, resulting in a decreased sperm count (azoospermia). This is the most likely explanation for the sterility of men who take large doses of testosterone-like androgenic steroids for long periods.

###Options:
A. ACE inhibitor
B. Thiazide
C. Acetaminophen
D. Calcium channel blocker
E. Loop diuretics


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. Loop diuretics. Loop diuretics are the most common precipitant of acute heart failure. They are diuretics that act directly on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. They increase the delivery of sodium and water to the distal nephron, which results in increased intravascular volume and increased cardiac preload. This can overwhelm the failing heart and precipitate acute decompensation.

The most common cause of such anisocoria is an iris or ciliary body lesion. Pilocarpine 1% is the most useful drug to differentiate between pupil-sparing lesions and pupil-gobbling lesions. Pilocarpine 1% paralyzes the sphincter pupillae muscle and allows the pupil to dilate in the dark, thus differentiating pupil-sparing lesions from pupil-gobbling lesions. Pilocarpine 1% also causes miosis in the light, thus differentiating pupil-gobbling lesions from myogenic anisocoria. Pilocarpine 2.5% and 3% are used to differentiate between pupil-gobbling lesions and adie tonic pupil."" - Clinical ophthalmology

###Question: If a radioimmunoassay is properly conducted and the amount of radioactive hormone bound to antibody is low, this would indicate which of the following?
###Options:
A. Plasma levels of endogenous hormone are high
B. Plasma levels of endogenous hormone are low
C. More antibody is needed
D. Less radioactive hormone is needed
E. None of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C, More antibody is needed. In a radioimmunoassay, the amount of radioactive hormone bound to antibody is a measure of the concentration of endogenous hormone in the sample. If the amount of radioactive hormone bound to antibody is low, it indicates that more antibody is needed to adequately measure the hormone in the sample. If the plasma levels of endogenous hormone are high, it would mean that there would be more antibody needed to adequately measure the hormone in the sample. However, this is not the case in the question. The plasma levels of endogenous hormone are low, not high. Therefore, Option A is incorrect. Similarly, the plasma levels of endogenous hormone are low, not high. Therefore, Option B is incorrect. The plasma levels of endogenous hormone are low, not high. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.

###Question:  A 78-year-old man comes to the office for a follow-up examination. He was discharged from the hospital 1 week ago after being treated for a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. He started treatment with ciprofloxacin and rifampin at that time. He also has hypertension and underwent placement of a mechanical aortic valve 6 years ago for aortic stenosis. Other current medications are hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and warfarin. His warfarin dose was doubled 4 days ago. He says that he is trying to follow a healthier diet. He drinks two 12-oz beers daily. Results of laboratory studies done 4 days ago and today are shown4 Days Ago TodayProthrombin time 11 sec (INR=1) 11.2 sec (INR=1.1)Partial thromboplastin time 29 sec 27 secWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's laboratory findings?
###Options:
A. Decreased protein binding
B. Eradication of gut flora
C. Increased alcohol intake
D. Increased vegetable consumption
E. Induction of cytochrome enzymes


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Decreased protein binding. The patient's prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are both elevated, indicating a coagulopathy. The patient's INR (International Normalized Ratio) is also elevated, indicating an increased prothrombin time relative to a control sample. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits, ruling out liver disease as the cause of the abnormal PT and PTT. The patient's INR is also elevated, indicating an increased prothrombin time relative to a control sample. The patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is also elevated, indicating a coagulopathy. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits, ruling out liver disease as the cause of the abnormal PT and PTT. The patient's elevated PT and PTT, along with the elevated INR, suggest that he is either overanticoagulated or has acquired a coagulopathy.

The patient's medications include warfarin, which is an oral anticoagulant. Warfarin is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, and its clearance is dependent on renal function. The patient's elevated PT and PTT, along with the elevated INR, suggest that he is either overanticoagulated or has acquired a coagulopathy. This could be due to a decrease in protein binding of warfarin, which would decrease its anticoagulant effect. This is the most likely cause of the patient's laboratory findings.

Which of the following electrolyte abnormalities is most commonly seen with this drug?
###Options:
A. Hypernatremia
B. Hyponatremia
C. Hypokalemia
D. Hyperkalemia
E. Hyperphosphatemia


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality associated with thiazide diuretics. Thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased excretion of potassium. This leads to volume contraction, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing further potassium excretion. Thiazide diuretics can also cause hyponatremia by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased absorption of sodium. This leads to volume expansion, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing further sodium retention. Thiazide diuretics can also cause hypercalcemia by inhibiting the sodium-phosphate symporter in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased absorption of phosphate. This leads to hypocalcemia. Thiazide diuretics can also cause hyperphosphatemia by inhibiting the sodium-phosphate symporter in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased absorption of phosphate. This leads to hypophosphatemia. Thiazide diuretics can also cause hypomagnesemia by inhibiting the sodium-magnesium symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased excretion of magnesium. This leads to volume contraction, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to further magnesium retention.

### Input:
###Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department for cough, fever, and diarrhea for the past 8 days. The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes metformin. He travels frequently and recently took a business trip to Canada for a 10-day conference. Vital signs show blood pressure 100/65 mm Hg, heart rate 67 bpm, and temperature 100 °F (37.8 °C). He appears confused. Chest x-ray shows lower lung consolidation. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated liver enzymes and hyponatremia. COVID PCR is negative. He is subsequently admitted to the inpatient unit. Which of the following tests is the gold standard for the diagnosis of this patient's illness?
###Options:
A. Polymerase chain reaction
B. Bronchoscopic lavage culture
C. Urinary antigen
D. enema
E. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Urinary antigen

The patient's presentation of cough, fever, diarrhea, confusion, and hyponatremia is concerning for a number of possibilities, including community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, and diabetic ketoacidosis. The lower lung consolidation on chest x-ray is also nonspecific. The negative COVID PCR makes COVID-19 less likely.

The patient's recent travel history and exposure to people with respiratory symptoms increase the likelihood of community-acquired pneumonia. The urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. The test detects the pneumococcal urinary antigen, which is a protein present in the cell wall of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A positive test indicates the presence of pneumococcal bacteria in the urine, indicating pneumococcal pneumonia.

The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and diarrhea, along with the chest x-ray findings of lower lung consolidation, are consistent with pneumococcal pneumonia. The patient's recent travel history and exposure to people with respiratory symptoms further increase the likelihood of community-acquired pneumonia. The urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. A positive test indicates the presence of pneumococcal bacteria in the urine, indicating pneumococcal pneumonia.

### Input:
###Question: A 23-year-old woman presents with left breast pain for 2 days. She is 3 weeks postpartum and breastfeeding without difficulty since delivery but is experiencing pain with nursing. Her temperature is 100.9 °F (38.3 °C), heart rate is 90 bpm, and blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg. The physical examination is significant for a small area of erythema and focal tenderness in her left breast, with no associated fluctuance. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?
###Options:
A. Left breast ultrasound
B. Metronidazole
C. Dicloxacillin
D. Vancomycin
E. Ciprofloxacin


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Left breast ultrasound:

The patient's postpartum status and breastfeeding difficulties are concerning for mastitis, which is an infection of the breast tissue. Mastitis can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. The most common presentation of mastitis is breast pain, often described as a sharp, stabbing pain that worsens with nursing. The patient's fever and focal tenderness are also consistent with mastitis.

The most appropriate management for mastitis is antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics for mastitis are penicillins, such as dicloxacillin or amoxicillin. Other antibiotics that can be used include first-generation cephalosporins, such as cefazolin, or vancomycin. The choice of antibiotic is based on the most likely pathogen causing the infection. In this case, the patient is 3 weeks postpartum and breastfeeding without difficulty, which makes Staphylococcus aureus a likely pathogen. Therefore, a penicillin such as dicloxacillin would be the most appropriate choice.

The second most appropriate management is left breast ultrasound:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are concerning for mastitis, which is an infection of the breast tissue. Ultrasound can help identify the presence of an abscess, which is a fluid collection within the breast tissue. Ultrasound is a non-invasive and painless imaging modality that uses sound waves to create images. It can help identify the presence of an abscess by showing a hypoechoic fluid collection surrounded by anechoic fluid, which represents pus. Ultrasound is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of mastitis and can help guide the management of the patient's condition.

The third most appropriate management is breastfeeding support:

Breastfeeding support is crucial for the management of mastitis. Mastitis can be a painful condition, and pain during breastfeeding can make it difficult for the mother to effectively empty her breast. Breastfeeding support can help the mother identify any areas of the breast that are causing discomfort or pain, allowing her to adjust her breastfeeding technique to alleviate any discomfort. Breastfeeding support can also help the mother identify any areas of the breast that are engorged or have areas of cracked nipples, which can also contribute to pain during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding support can help the mother identify any areas of the breast that are causing discomfort, allowing her to adjust her breastfeeding technique to alleviate any discomfort. Breastfeeding support can also help the mother identify any areas of the breast that are engorged or have areas of cracked nipples, which can also contribute to pain during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding support can help the mother identify any areas of the breast that are causing discomfort, helping to alleviate any pain and discomfort.

The fourth most appropriate management is antibiotics:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are concerning for mastitis, which is an infection of the breast tissue. Mastitis can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus. The most appropriate management for mastitis is antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics for mastitis are penicillins, such as dicloxacillin. Other antibiotics that can be used include first-generation cephalosporins, such as cefazolin, or vancomycin. The choice of antibiotic is based on the most likely pathogen causing the infection, which is usually Staphylococcus aureus.

The fifth most appropriate management is cessation of breastfeeding:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are concerning for mastitis, which is an infection of the breast tissue. Mastitis can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus. The most appropriate management for mastitis is cessation of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding can exacerbate mastitis by increasing the blood supply to the breast, which can increase the risk of in"

###Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 10-year history of heartburn that occurs after he eats late at night or consumes spicy food. He has had no weight loss or difficulty swallowing. He takes over-the-counter antacids as needed, but they relieve his discomfort only temporarily. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An endoscopy is done. The distal esophagus is shown in the photograph. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A. Defect in secretin production
B. Excessive gastrin production
C. Excessive transient lower esophageal relaxations
D. Failure of primary esophageal peristalsis
E. Failure of saliva production


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Failure of primary esophageal peristalsis. This patient's symptoms of heartburn that occurs after eating and is relieved only temporarily by antacids are classic for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to maintain its normal high pressure, allowing acidic contents in the stomach to reflux into the distal esophagus. This leads to a burning sensation in the throat or chest.

The distal esophagus in the photograph shows a normal appearance, indicating that there is no evidence of erosive or inflammatory changes associated with GERD. This makes option D the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Failure of primary esophageal peristalsis is a condition that causes dysmotility of the esophagus, leading to difficulty in emptying food from the esophagus into the stomach. This condition is not associated with heartburn.

Option A, Defect in secretin production, is not related to GERD. Secretin is a hormone that stimulates the exocrine pancreas to release enzymes and bicarbonate. Deficiency of secretin production would not directly cause GERD.

Option B, Excessive gastrin production, is also not related to GERD. Gastrin is a hormone that stimulates the stomach to release acid. Excessive gastrin production would not directly cause GERD.

Option C, Excessive transient lower esophageal relaxations, is the correct answer. Transient lower esophageal relaxations (TLESRs) are brief episodes of relaxation of the LES. TLESRs are a normal physiological response that occurs to allow for swallowed food to pass into the stomach. However, in individuals with GERD, TLESRs can occur more frequently, leading to reflux of acidic contents into the esophagus. This is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option E, Failure of saliva production, is not related to GERD. Saliva production is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, and failure of saliva production would not directly cause GERD.

###Options:
A. Neurocardiogenic syncope
B. Third-degree AV block
C. Ventricular tachycardia
D. Seizure
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B, Third-degree AV block. This patient's symptoms of palpitations, syncope, and driving off the side of the road are indicative of a loss of consciousness. The absence of recollection of the events that transpired suggests amnesia, which is commonly seen in third-degree AV block. Third-degree AV block is characterized by an electrocardiographic finding of intermittent failure of atrial electrical impulse conduction to the ventricles, resulting in a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. This can lead to symptoms of palpitations, lightheadedness, and syncope due to the decreased ventricular rate. The patient's car driving issues are likely due to the syncopal episodes.

###Question: A 65-year-old man from a nursing home is brought to the emergency department, complaining of increased lethargy for the last 2 days. His past medical history is significant for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease status-post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 5 years ago, and obstructive sleep apnea. On examination, he appears drowsy but is easily rousable. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. Physical examination reveals prominent jugular venous pulsations, bilateral basal inspiratory crackles, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. His extremities are cold to touch. No focal deficits are noted. A computed tomogram (CT) of the brain is unremarkable. Vitals reveal a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 70/52 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry of 88% on room air. A chest x-ray reveals signs of bilateral pulmonary congestion. The patient is started on norepinephrine and transferred to the intensive care unit for further management. Which of the following findings is most likely to be appreciated on right heart catheterization in this patient?
###Options:
A. Low right atrial pressure
B. Low left atrial pressure
C. High pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
D. Low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
E. ventricular failure


### Response: The correct answer is"," C: High pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of acute decompensated heart failure with low cardiac output and elevated pulmonary pressures. The elevated jugular venous pressure, inspiratory crackles, and peripheral edema are all consistent with pulmonary congestion. The low blood pressure and oxygen saturation on room air are also indicative of poor tissue perfusion. Right heart catheterization is a valuable tool in the assessment of patients with heart failure. It allows for direct measurement of pressures in the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and filling pressures of the left atrium and left ventricle. In this patient, the elevated right atrial pressure suggests right-sided heart failure, which can be seen in conditions such as tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonary hypertension. The elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests increased left atrial pressure and pulmonary congestion, which is consistent with the physical examination findings. The low left ventricular pressures indicate that the left ventricle is unable to adequately pump blood into the systemic circulation. The low cardiac output is likely a result of the decompensated heart failure.

###Question: A 27-year-old man is examined in the intensive care unit 1 day after he sustained a closed head injury, liver laceration, and pelvic fracture in a motor vehicle collision. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is receiving intravenous midazolam and 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer solution. Temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft. He withdraws appropriately to painful stimuli. Laboratory studies show:Hematocrit 28%Leukocyte count 13,000/mm3SerumNa  138 mEq/LK  3.5 mEq/LCl− 102 mEq/LHCO3− 24 mEq/LUrea nitrogen 20 mg/dLGlucose 220 mg/dLCreatinine 1 mg/dLWhich of the following is the most likely mechanism of these laboratory findings?
###Options:
A. Decreased uptake of glucose by insulin-sensitive tissues
B. Exogenous production of glucose by bacteria
C. Impaired excretion of glucose by the kidneys
D. Increased infusion of intravenous glucose
E. Insulin deficiency


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C, impaired excretion of glucose by the kidneys.

The laboratory findings show an elevated blood glucose level (hyperglycemia) and an elevated blood urea nitrogen level (mild azotemia). The hematocrit, leukocyte count, and serum electrolytes are all within normal limits. The elevated blood glucose level is most likely due to impaired glucose excretion by the kidneys.

In the setting of a closed head injury, liver laceration, and pelvic fracture, the patient is at risk for developing an insulin-resistant, hyperglycemic state known as stress hyperglycemia. This is due to the release of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, growth hormone, and catecholamines, which stimulate gluconeogenesis and inhibit glycogenolysis. The liver responds by producing more glucose from amino acids and glycerol, and by converting more fatty acids into ketone bodies. The resulting hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia can lead to impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake by insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue. This results in hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia.

Insulin-resistant states can also lead to impaired excretion of glucose by the kidneys. This is due to the inability of the kidneys to respond to insulin's inhibitory effect on glucose reabsorption. The kidneys fail to appropriately increase glucose filtration and decrease glucose reabsorption, leading to glucosuria.

The patient in the case is at risk for developing stress hyperglycemia due to his traumatic injuries. This can lead to impaired excretion of glucose by the kidneys, resulting in hyperglycemia and mild azotemia.

The other options do not fit the laboratory findings described. Decreased uptake of glucose by insulin-sensitive tissues would lead to decreased blood glucose levels, not hyperglycemia. Exogenous production of glucose by bacteria (Option B) would lead to hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia. Impaired excretion of glucose by the kidneys (Option C) would lead to hyperglycemia and azotemia, not mild azotemia. Insulin deficiency (Option E) would lead to hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia.

###Question: A 70-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of severe right-sided abdominal pain radiating into her groin. She states that the pain came on after lifting something heavy, and her legs gave way. Subsequently, she has been unable to pass any bowel movements. During the musculoskeletal system examination, her hip movements are severely reduced on the right side, with the pain worsening on the internal rotation of the hip. Which of the following best identifies the structures compressed by the most likely pathology in this patient?
###Options:
A. Obturator nerve, artery, and vein
B. Obturator nerve, internal iliac artery, and vein
C. Femoral nerve, external iliac artery, and femoral vein
D. Sacral nerves
E. internal pudendal artery, and venous plexus


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Obturator nerve, artery, and vein. The obturator nerve innervates the muscles of the adductor compartment of the thigh. The obturator artery and vein run deep to the nerve and cross the obturator canal. The obturator nerve, artery, and vein are compressed by the obturator hernia, which occurs when abdominal contents herniate through the obturator canal. This can cause severe pain in the distribution of the obturator nerve. The obturator hernia is more common in elderly women, and the pain is often described as severe and radiates into the groin. The obturator hernia is a surgical emergency, and the diagnosis is typically made with a physical examination.

###Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the office for four days of rapid, jerky movements of his hands. His temperature is 103 F. On physical examination, he moves his hands frequently and erratically and has faintly erythematous circular lesions on his abdomen. On cardiac auscultation, he has a new systolic murmur. What is the mechanism underlying this patient's condition?
###Options:
A. Embolization from an infected thrombus
B. Immune complex deposition and inflammation
C. Cross-reactive antibodies against bacterial and host antigens
D. Activation of T cells by antigen
E. Activation of B cells by antigen


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Activation of T cells by antigen.

The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which is a systemic inflammatory disease that occurs following group A streptococcal infection. The classic triad of ARF includes carditis, arthritis, and subcutaneous nodules. The mechanism underlying ARF is the activation of T cells by antigen, leading to the production of autoantibodies. These autoantibodies then cross-react with host tissues, leading to the clinical manifestations seen in ARF.

Infected thrombi can lead to embolization and subsequent infarction, but this is not the primary mechanism underlying ARF. Immune complex deposition and inflammation are seen in acute glomerulonephritis, but this is not the primary mechanism underlying ARF. Cross-reactive antibodies against bacterial and host antigens can lead to autoimmune diseases such as Goodpasture syndrome, but this is not the primary mechanism underlying ARF. Activation of B cells by antigen is seen in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but this is not the primary mechanism underlying ARF.

C. Assess stressors in the client life
D. Decrease venous return to the heart
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," option D - decrease venous return to the heart. The client is presenting with signs of left sided heart failure which is a consequence of increased venous return to the hea. The goal of treatment in this case is to decrease venous return to the hea. This can be achieved by administering diuretics to increase urine output, thereby decreasing intravascular volume. This will also decrease venous return to the hea and decrease the workload on the hea.

### Input:
###Question: A 66-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus presents with non-specific chest pain. During her hospital stay, she develops hypotension and a change in mental status. Her examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distension, and she is diagnosed with cardiac tamponade. What is the next step in management?
###Options:
A. Oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide
B. Endotracheal intubation
C. Cardiac catheterization and labetalol infusion
D. Bi-level positive airway pressure and bedside pericardiocentesis
E. bed-side pericardiocentesis


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide. The next step in management of cardiac tamponade is to immediately begin resuscitation with oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide. This approach is necessary to restore cardiac output and improve hemodynamics. The patient's clinical presentation of hypotension and change in mental status is consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency. Cardiac tamponade is a condition in which fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, causing compression of the heart and impaired cardiac filling. It is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. The most common cause of cardiac tamponade is malignancy, especially in older individuals. Other causes include infections, autoimmune diseases, and post-cardiac injury syndrome. The most common symptoms of cardiac tamponade are non-specific, including dyspnea, malaise, and fatigue. However, hypotension and a change in mental status are indicative of a more urgent and life-threatening condition. The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is made by echocardiography, which shows a large pericardial effusion, right-sided collapse, and diagnostic findings such as early right ventricular diastolic filling and septal shift. The treatment of choice for cardiac tamponade is pericardiocentesis, which involves the insertion of a needle into the pericardial space to drain the accumulated fluid. This procedure is usually performed under ultrasound guidance, and a pigtail catheter is left in place to allow for continuous drainage. The mainstay of treatment for cardiac tamponade is the prompt initiation of resuscitation with oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis. This approach is necessary to restore cardiac output and improve hemodynamics.

### Input:
###Question: A 58-year-old female who resides in California and has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis presents with symptoms of fatigue and weakness, which started 3 weeks ago. Her vitals upon triage at the clinic are a blood pressure of 120/87 mmHg, a temperature of 36.7 C, pulse oximetry of 97% on room air, and heart rate of 50 beats/min. An electrocardiogram is done which shows sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 57 beats/min. She denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, or recent travel. Which of the following is the best next test to order?
###Options:
A. Thyroid stimulating hormone level
B. Chest X-ray
C. Serial troponins
D. Serologic test for Lyme disease
E. ultrasound


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C: Serial troponins. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and weakness, along with an electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 57 beats/min, are suggestive of bradycardia. The most likely cause of bradycardia in this patient is ischemic heart disease, which can be exacerbated by her risk factors of diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis. Serial troponins are a good next step to monitor for any potential myocardial damage or injury that may be occurring due to the ischemic heart disease. Serial troponins are a blood test that measures the levels of cardiac-specific troponin I and troponin T proteins in the blood. These proteins are released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart muscle, such as from a heart attack. Serial troponin levels can help determine if there is an increase or decrease in cardiac damage over time, which can help guide treatment decisions. Serial troponins are not typically ordered for routine screening, but rather for specific situations such as suspected heart attacks. Serial troponin levels can also be ordered in patients with known heart disease to monitor for any changes in cardiac function. Serial troponin levels are not the best next test to order for options A, B, D, and E. Thyroid stimulating hormone level can be used to evaluate for hypothyroidism, which can cause bradycardia. However, the symptoms and history provided do not suggest hypothyroidism as the cause of bradycardia in this patient. Chest X-rays can be used to evaluate for any signs of lung pathology, such as pneumonia or lung cancer, which can cause bradycardia. However, the symptoms and history provided do not suggest lung pathology as the cause of bradycardia in this patient. Serologic tests for Lyme disease can be used to evaluate for Lyme disease, which can cause bradycardia. However, the symptoms and history provided do not suggest Lyme disease as the cause of bradycardia in this patient. An ultrasound is not the best next test to order for this patient.

If this test is negative, then further evaluation would be necessary. Endometrial biopsy would be the most appropriate next step, as it could help rule out endometrial pathology such as hyperplasia or cancer. Pelvic ultrasonography would be the next best step, as it could help identify any structural abnormalities in the uterus or ovaries. However, since the patient's symptoms are suggestive of an endocrine disorder, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate cyclic progestin therapy. This would help regulate her menstrual cycle and treat the underlying pathology.

###Question: Which hormone is responsible for regulating blood glucose levels during fasting or between meals?
###Options:
A. Insulin
B. Glucagon
C. Cortisol
D. Thyroxine
E. Epinephrine


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Insulin. Insulin is responsible for regulating blood glucose levels during fasting or between meals. Glucagon is secreted by the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels and helps to restore blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis in the liver. Cortisol is released by the adrenal glands in response to stress and helps to mobilize energy stores. Thyroxine is a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine and is produced by the thyroid gland. Epinephrine is released by the adrenal medulla in response to stress and helps to mobilize energy stores.

###Question: A 45-year-old Nigerian patient is evaluated for fatigue and shortness of breath. He also reports low urine output for the past 2 days. He has no past medical illnesses and takes no medications. He has a family history of high blood pressure and kidney disease in his family. He says he was advised to take hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure 10 years ago, but he did not follow up with any doctor. His vital signs are heart rate 99 bpm, blood pressure 178/94 mm Hg, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and temperature 37.2 °C (99 °F). His blood work reveals the following: BUN 176 mg/dL, creatinine 8.5 mg/dL, sodium 139 mEQ/L, potassium 5.7 mEQ/L, HCO3 17 mEQ/L. A urinalysis is ordered but is not able to be obtained because of the patient's anuria. An ultrasound of the retroperitoneum does not show any renal or ureteral obstruction. A decision is made to start hemodialysis. Which of the following is the most feared preventable complication while initiating renal replacement therapy in this patient?
###Options:
A. Hyperkalemia
B. Metabolic alkalosis
C. Cerebral edema
D. Pulmonary edema
E. Metabolic acidosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Pulmonary edema. This patient's history of low urine output, elevated BUN and creatinine, as well as the presence of pulmonary edema, are suggestive of fluid overload. This fluid overload is likely a result of his non-compliance with medication, leading to the development of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, which can lead to fluid overload. Pulmonary edema is a known complication of fluid overload, as the excess fluid from the body goes to the lungs causing them to become engorged and unable to effectively exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can lead to respiratory distress and pulmonary edema.

The other choices are not the most feared preventable complications in this patient. Hyperkalemia is a known complication of renal failure, but it is not the most feared preventable complication in this patient. Metabolic alkalosis is a known complication of hydrochlorothiazide use, but it is not the most feared preventable complication in this patient. Cerebral edema is a known complication of rapid fluid shifts, but it is not the most feared preventable complication in this patient. Metabolic acidosis is a known complication of renal failure, but it is not the most feared preventable complication in this patient.

###Options:
A. To reduce tubular reabsorption of phenobarbital.
B. To decrease ionization of phenobarbital
C. To increase glomerular filtration of phenobarbital.
D. To decrease proximal tubular secretion.
E. To increase tubular reabsorption of phenobarbital


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: To reduce tubular reabsorption of phenobarbital. Alkalization of urine by giving bicarbonate will increase the pH of the urine. At higher pH, the unionized form of phenobarbital (a weak acid) is more predominant than the ionized form. The unionized form is less soluble and thus less reabsorbed by the tubules. This will lead to increased excretion of phenobarbital.

###Options:
A. true
B. false
C. N/A
D. N/A
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," option A true. Xanthinuria is a condition that does not occur during treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are medications that work by blocking the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for breaking down purines into uric acid. By blocking this enzyme, xanthine oxidase inhibitors prevent the breakdown of purines into uric acid. This results in a buildup of purines, which can lead to symptoms of gout. However, xanthine oxidase inhibitors do not cause xanthinuria, which is a condition where the body is unable to break down purines into uric acid. Xanthinuria is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of purines. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase, which is responsible for breaking down purines into uric acid. Patients with xanthinuria are unable to break down purines, leading to high levels of uric acid in the blood. This buildup of uric acid can cause gout-like symptoms. However, xanthinuria is not caused by xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are medications that work by blocking the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for breaking down purines into uric acid.

###Question: In a young child who has presented with UTI, what is the most important follow up first line investigation after the correct initial management has been put in place?
###Options:
A. US Kidneys and Renal Tract
B. XR Abdomen
C. Micturating Cystourethrogram
D. CT KUB
E. Regular Urinalysis


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Micturating Cystourethrogram. The most important follow up investigation in a young child who has presented with UTI is micturating cystourethrogram. The micturating cystourethrogram is the best way to detect posterior urethral valves, posterior urethral diverticulum, vesico ureteric reflux and ureterocele. The micturating cystourethrogram is done after 3 months of antibiotic therapy. The micturating cystourethrogram is done using water soluble contrast. The child is asked to void and the micturating cystourethrogram is done. The child is then asked to void again and the bladder is filled with water soluble contrast and the micturating cystourethrogram is repeated. The micturating cystourethrogram is done under fluoroscopy. The micturating cystourethrogram is done to detect posterior urethral valves, posterior urethral diverticulum, vesico ureteric reflux and ureterocele. The posterior urethral valves are leaflets of the urethra which are located at the level of the verumontanum. The posterior urethral diverticulum is a pouch or sac formation in the posterior urethra. The posterior urethral diverticulum is usually located at the verumontanum. The vesico ureteric reflux is the back flow of urine from the bladder into the ureter. The ureterocele is a sac formation in the ureter. The posterior urethral valves, posterior urethral diverticulum and vesico ureteric reflux are associated with UTI. The posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of UTI in boys. The posterior urethral diverticulum is the second most common cause of UTI in boys.

###Question: A 22-year-old Caucasian woman presents with a 1-day history of a painful right leg which is erythematous on appearance and tender on palpation. She states that she has had this problem many times in the last few years and her family has also suffered from similar problems. Her grandmother died of a pulmonary embolism. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A. Antithrombin deficiency
B. Factor V Leiden mutation
C. Protein S deficiency
D. Lupus anticoagulant
E. Protein C deficiency


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Factor V Leiden mutation. This is a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding factor V Leiden, which is a variant of human factor V. It is a missense mutation that results in resistance to cleavage by protein C. This leads to a hypercoagulable state and is the most common inherited cause of venous thrombosis. The patient's family history of similar symptoms and the presence of a hypercoagulable state are consistent with this diagnosis. Antithrombin deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results in a deficiency of antithrombin III, a serine protease inhibitor. Protein S deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in a deficiency of protein S, a cofactor for protein C. Protein C deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in a deficiency of protein C, a cofactor for activated protein C. Lupus anticoagulant is an autoimmune disorder that results in the production of antibodies that bind to plasma proteins, including anticoagulant proteins such as protein S. These antibodies interfere with the ability of protein S to bind to and inactivate activated protein C, leading to a hypercoagulable state.

###Options:
A. They act by inhibiting the ability of renin to convert angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.
B. Enalapril is a prodrug that is converted to an active metabolite
C. They reduce secretion of aldosterone
D. They can produce hyperkalemia in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic
E. n/a


### Response: The correct answer is"," option D, which states that ACE inhibitors do not produce hyperkalemia in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic. ACE inhibitors do not cause hyperkalemia, but they do increase the risk of hypokalemia. This is because ACE inhibitors inhibit the breakdown of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which normally has a potassium-sparing effect. Potassium-sparing diuretics work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium pump in the distal tubule, which leads to increased reabsorption of potassium. Therefore, when used in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic, ACE inhibitors can cause a decrease in potassium levels.

A. Decreases overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid
B. Blocks the receptor site for epinephrine and norepinephrine
C. Corrects hyponatremia
D. Acts on GABA receptors causing post-synaptic inhibition
E. Corrects hypernatremia


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Decreases overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid.

Option A: Decreases overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid
This option is referring to the medication that is used to treat porphyria. In this case, the patient has a compound tibia fracture and has a history of porphyria. The goal of the medication is to decrease the overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which is a precursor to porphyrins. Porphyrins are toxic and can lead to acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). By decreasing the overproduction of ALA, the medication is aiming to decrease the risk of AIP.

###Question: A previously healthy 45-year-old woman who works as a park ranger comes to the physician because of a 1-week historyof shortness of breath, even at rest. She has lived in the mountains at 10,000 feet above sea level for 2 years; thephysician’s office is located at sea level. Her pulse is 85/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mmHg. Physical examination while sitting upright shows jugular venous distention and 2  pedal edema. During the past 2years, which of the following has most likely decreased in this patient?
###Options:
A. Height of P waves in lead I of the patient's ECG
B. Height of R waves in lead V1 of the patient's ECG
C. Hematocrit
D. Pulmonary vascular resistance
E. Right ventricular diastolic compliance


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, even at rest, along with jugular venous distention and pedal edema, suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension. The ECG findings of right axis detion and right ventricular hyperophy are also suggestive of chronic pulmonary hypertension. The patient's occupation as a park ranger at high altitude likely contributes to the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension.

Option A: The height of P waves in lead I of the patient's ECG is not likely to be decreased in this patient. P wave height is typically used to assess atrial electrical activity, and decreased height would suggest a disturbance in atrial electrical conduction. This finding is not specific to chronic pulmonary hypertension.

Option B: The height of R waves in lead V1 of the patient's ECG is not likely to be decreased in this patient. R wave height is typically used to assess ventricular depolarization, and decreased height would suggest a disturbance in ventricular depolarization. This finding is not specific to chronic pulmonary hypertension.

Option C: Hematocrit is not likely to be decreased in this patient. Hematocrit is a measure of the percentage of red blood cells in a blood sample, and a decrease in hematocrit would suggest a decrease in red blood cell count. While chronic pulmonary hypertension can lead to a decrease in red blood cell count, the question does not provide any information to suggest a decrease in hematocrit.

Option D: Pulmonary vascular resistance is the most likely factor to have decreased in this patient. Chronic pulmonary hypertension can lead to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, resulting in increased pressures in the pulmonary circulation and ultimately pulmonary hypertension. The symptoms of shortness of breath, even at rest, along with jugular venous distention and pedal edema, suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance would alleviate these symptoms and signs, making this the most likely answer.

### Input:
###Question: A 50-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after he was found down in his apartment. He has a history of anxiety, COPD, and chronic back pain. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient is comatose and breathing at 8 breaths per minute. After securing the airway and placing the intravenous line, the patient is hemodynamically stable. The patient takes several medications for his problems but the daughter at bedside does not remember the names. Which of the following is the most likely cause of respiratory distress in this patient?
###Options:
A. Combination of chlordiazepoxide with opioid
B. Combination of chlordiazepoxide with metoprolol
C. Combination of chlordiazepoxide with Ibuprofen
D. Combination of chlordiazepoxide with acetaminophen
E. Combination of chlordiazepoxide with paracetamol


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Combination of chlordiazepoxide with Ibuprofen. This patient is likely taking a benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide. Benzodiazepines are known to cause respiratory depression when combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. This combination can result in a decrease in respiratory drive and depression of ventilatory function. The patient's history of anxiety, COPD, and chronic back pain may be managed with other medications. However, the patient's respiratory distress may be related to the combination of chlordiazepoxide with ibuprofen.

###Question: A 14-year-old boy presents with a fever and difficulty swallowing for 2 days. He was treated for tonsillitis 2 weeks ago, his parents report a ""muffled and nasal"" voice, and he is up to date with his vaccinations. His vitals are temperature 38.3 °C (101 °F), heart rate 93 bpm, and respiratory rate 19 breaths/min. The physical examination demonstrates drooling, swelling and pus on the right tonsil, a deviated uvula towards the left, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The abdominal examination shows no organomegaly. A complete blood count with differential is significant for leukocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?
###Options:
A. Streptococcus pyogenes
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Streptococcus pneumoniae
D. Moraxella catarrhalis
E. Streptococcus pyogenes


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Streptococcus pyogenes. This patient's presentation is consistent with acute pharyngotonsillitis, which is commonly caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes). The patient's symptoms of fever, difficulty swallowing, and muffled and nasal voice are classic signs of acute pharyngotonsillitis. The physical examination findings of tonsillar swelling, pus, and a deviated uvula are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's leukocytosis and the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes infection in the oropharynx are also associated with an increased risk of acute rheumatic fever. Acute rheumatic fever is characterized by migratory polyarthritis, which can present as fever, joint pain, and decreased range of motion. The patient's age and lack of history of recent streptococcal infection or rheumatic fever make Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae less likely. Staphylococcus aureus infection is more commonly associated with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, which presents with fever, bone pain, and decreased range of motion. Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is more commonly associated with pneumonia, which presents with fever, cough, and respiratory distress. Moraxella catarrhalis is a common cause of otitis media, which presents with ear pain, fever, and ear discharge.

###Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents 30 minutes after the sudden onset ofconfusion, sweating, and pallor. He has enuresis treated with imipramine. His parents refilled his prescription forimipramine 3 days ago and noted today that the bottle is empty. On arrival, the patient is awake but confused.Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg.Examination shows dilated pupils and flushed skin. In addition to ensuring an adequate airway and establishingintravenous access, which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?
###Options:
A. Cardiac monitoring
B. Chest x-ray
C. Echocardiography
D. EEG
E. Measurement of serum imipramine concentration


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. The patient's symptoms of confusion, sweating, and pallor, along with the history of recent imipramine refilling, suggest a possible overdose. The imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that can cause anticholinergic effects, including mydriasis, confusion, and decreased sweating. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a TCA overdose, so the most appropriate initial step in management would be to measure the serum concentration of the TCA. This would help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are potent anticholinergic drugs that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, confusion, and urinary retention. These effects are due to the anticholinergic effects of the medication, not the class effect. The symptoms of confusion and mydriasis in this patient are consistent with a TCA overdose, so the most appropriate initial step in management would be to measure the serum concentration of the TCA. This would help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

TCAs have a narrow therapeutic index, and overdoses can lead to severe central anticholinergic syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a triad of symptoms: dry mouth, confusion, and urinary retention. Other symptoms can include flushed skin, mydriasis, decreased sweating, and seizures. The management of a TCA overdose involves discontinuing the medication, ensuring an adequate airway, and monitoring for signs of toxicity. In severe cases, atropine can be used to counteract the anticholinergic effects.

While the patient's symptoms are consistent with a TCA overdose, the specific medication involved cannot be determined based on the symptoms alone. The measurement of the serum concentration of the TCA would help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is to measure the serum concentration of the TCA.

Measurement of the serum concentration of the TCA can be performed using gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, or mass spectrometry. These tests measure the concentration of the TCA in the blood. The therapeutic range for TCAs is narrow, and concentrations above 20 ng/mL are considered toxic. In this case, the patient's serum concentration is likely above the toxic range, which would suggest a TCA overdose.

While waiting for the serum concentration results, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity. The management of TCA overdose involves discontinuing the medication, ensuring an adequate airway, and monitoring for signs of toxicity. In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with a TCA overdose, so the most appropriate management would be to discontinue the medication.

Discontinuing the medication is the first step in managing a TCA overdose. Imipramine is a TCA that can be life-threatening in overdose. Immediate medical intervention is necessary to ensure an adequate airway and prevent complications. In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with a TCA overdose, so the most appropriate management would be to discontinue the medication.

###Question: A 40-year-old woman presents to the clinic with upper abdominal pain and nausea for the last 3 months. The pain is dull, worse in between meals, and is 5/10 in intensity. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heavy smoking. The physical examination shows discomfort in the epigastric area. An upper endoscopy shows an ulcer in the duodenal bulb. Biopsy of the stomach lining reveals inflammation affecting the antrum but sparing the body and the fundus, as well as colonization by Helicobacter pylori and decreased numbers of D cells. Which of the following is expected to be seen in this patient?
###Options:
A. Decreased gastrin due to loss of G cells
B. Decreased gastrin due to loss of C cells
C. ncreased pepsinogen secretion due to high levels of gastrin
D. Decreased pepsin activation due to high pH
E. Hypoplasia of gastrin-releasing G cells


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Decreased gastrin due to loss of G cells. This patient's upper endoscopy shows an ulcer in the duodenal bulb, which is a classic location for gastrinomas. Gastrinomas are tumors that produce gastrin, which stimulates acid secretion in the stomach. The presence of an ulcer in the duodenal bulb suggests that the gastrin production is causing acid hypersecretion, which can lead to peptic ulcers. Gastrinomas are most commonly found in the pancreas, and they are most commonly found in the gastrin-releasing G (GRG) cells of the gastrin-producing cell cluster (GCL). These GRG cells are located in the wall of the gastrin-producing cell cluster (GCL), which is located in the pyloric region of the stomach. The GRG cells are responsible for secreting gastrin, which stimulates the secretion of acid in the stomach. The presence of an ulcer in the duodenal bulb suggests that the gastrin production is causing acid hypersecretion, which can lead to peptic ulcers. The loss of GRG cells in this patient would result in a decrease in gastrin production, leading to decreased acid secretion and a decrease in peptic ulcers. This is the correct answer.

###Question: A 60-year-old man presents with a painful, swollen area on his left leg. He reports several similar episodes in other areas of his extremities. He denies a history of fever, body aches, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or other associated symptoms. He has a medical history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension. His vital signs are normal. On physical examination, he has a dark complexion and conjunctival icterus. He has no chest wall or abdominal tenderness. There is a tender, warm, erythematous, cord-like area in the medial distal left thigh. In addition to a radiographic evaluation of the left lower extremity, which of the following diagnostic studies is also indicated?
###Options:
A. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain
C. Lumbar puncture
D. Electromyography
E. x-ray


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Lumbar puncture:

The patient's presentation of painful, swollen area on his extremity, with conjunctival icterus, suggests a diagnosis of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. This is a serious condition that requires prompt evaluation and treatment. The most common organisms causing vertebral osteomyelitis are Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli. The patient's dark complexion and conjunctival icterus are consistent with obstructive jaundice, which can be seen in patients with cholangitis. Cholangitis can lead to septic emboli that can seed the vertebral osteomyelitis. Therefore, a lumbar puncture is indicated to evaluate for the presence of bacterial meningitis, which can be a devastating complication of vertebral osteomyelitis.

The other diagnostic studies listed in the options are not indicated at this time. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain are not necessary for the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis. These studies are typically used to evaluate for other causes of back pain, such as tumors or abscesses. Electromyography is not indicated in this case. While neurologic deficits can occur in vertebral osteomyelitis, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with an infectious process affecting the bone rather than a neurologic deficit.

###Question: A 29-year-old man is incidentally discovered to have left hilar adenopathy on routine chest radiography for life insurance. Subsequent CT scanning confirms enlarged left hilar and paraaortic lymph nodes. He is otherwise healthy. In addition to lymph node biopsy, what other diagnostic step is warranted?
###Options:
A. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level
B. β-hCG
C. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
D. C-reactive protein
E. PSA


### Response: The correct answer is"," A, and the analysis is as follows:

The patient's age, gender, and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes in the left hilum and para-aortic area are all suggestive of a diagnosis of lymphoma. The next step in the workup of lymphoma is to determine the type of lymphoma. The most common type of lymphoma is non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is further subdivided into activated B-cell-like (ABC-like) and germinal center B-cell-like (GCB-like) subtypes. The most common subtype in young adults is the GCB-like subtype.

The next step in the workup of lymphoma is to determine the stage of the disease. This is done using a staging system such as the Ann Arbor staging system. The stage of the disease is important because it will guide treatment decisions. The stage of the disease is also important for prognostication purposes.

The next step in the workup of lymphoma is to determine the etiology of the disease. This is done using a diagnostic test such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology. EBV serology is important because it can help determine if the lymphoma is EBV-associated, which is more common in the GCB-like subtype of DLBCL.

The next step in the workup of lymphoma is to determine the histologic subtype of the lymphoma. This is done using a diagnostic test such as flow cytometry. Flow cytometry is important because it can help determine if the lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma or a T-cell lymphoma. B-cell lymphomas are further subdivided into Burkitt lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and DLBCL. T-cell lymphomas are further subdivided into peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and extranodal nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, NOS.

The next step in the workup of lymphoma is to determine the prognosis of the disease. This is done using a prognostic test such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI). The IPI is important because it can help determine the risk of relapse and overall survival in patients with lymphoma.

The final step in the workup of lymphoma is to determine the treatment options for the patient. This is done using a diagnostic test such as flow cytometry. Flow cytometry is important because it can help determine the subtype of lymphoma and guide treatment options.

The correct answer is Option A, and the analysis is as follows:

The patient's age, gender, and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes in the left hilum and para-aortic area are all suggestive of a diagnosis of lymphoma. The most common type of lymphoma in young adults is the GCB-like subtype of DLBCL. The most common subtype of lymphoma in young adults is DLBCL.

### Input:
###Question: A 37-year-old man who is a carpenter is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after the sudden onset of fever, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Four days ago, he sustained a puncture wound to his left hand; he treated the wound with antibacterial cream and a bandage. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination of the left hand shows diffuse swelling, erythema, and a 2-cm, necrotic puncture wound. His leukocyte count is 14,000/mm3. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows a PCO2 of less than 32 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely infectious agent in this patient?
###Options:
A. Clostridium tetani
B. Mycobacterium abscessus
C. Pasteurella multocida
D. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
E. Staphylococcus aureus


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. Staphylococcus aureus. This patient's symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and palpitations, along with the necrotic puncture wound, are indicative of a severe infection. The low PCO2 suggests respiratory compromise, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. The most likely infectious agent in this case is Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of necrotizing soft tissue infections. These infections often occur in individuals with puncture wounds, as in this patient. The bacteria can produce exotoxins that cause tissue necrosis and systemic effects. The other options are not likely pathogens in this case. Clostridium tetani causes tetanus, which presents with muscle stiffness and spasms. Mycobacterium abscessus is associated with chronic granulomatous disease and is not typically associated with puncture wounds. Pasteurella multocida is a common cause of infections in animals, but not humans. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections, but not typically associated with puncture wounds.

###Question: A forty year old man presents with cold intolerance and weightgain. Examination reveals goiter. The most likely finding oncentral nervous system examination is:
###Options:
A. Ataxia
B. Delayed relaxation of ankle jerk
C. Hypotonia
D. Hyper reflexia
E. Loss of sensations


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Ataxia. The presence of goiter in combination with the clinical features suggests a diagnosis of myxedema coma. Myxedema coma is a rare, life-threatening condition that occurs in severely hypothyroid patients. It is characterized by a decreased level of consciousness, which may progress to coma, and generalized edema. It is associated with a very slow pulse, a low body temperature, and hypoventilation. It is also associated with a characteristic myxedematous skin, which is caused by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis. The myxedematous skin is also associated with a characteristic facies, which includes puffy eyelids, a broad nasal bridge, and a protruding tongue. The skin changes are caused by the decreased activity of hyaluronidase, an enzyme that normally breaks down glycosaminoglycans. The decreased activity of this enzyme results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the skin. The most common cause of myxedema coma is hypothyroidism, paicularly in the elderly. Other causes include severe malnutrition, malignancy, and drugs that interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis. The most common precipitating factor is a cold environment. The treatment of myxedema coma involves the administration of intravenous thyroxine, which is the active form of thyroid hormone. The treatment also includes the administration of glucocoicoids, which are used to treat the associated edema.

### Input:
###Question: A 34-year-old woman with myasthenia gravis comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history ofincreasing weakness, shortness of breath, and abdominal cramping. Current medications are prednisone andpyridostigmine. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 45/min, and respirations are 25/min and shallow. Her voiceis soft and hypernasal, and she coughs weakly when swallowing water. Breath and heart sounds are normal. Pulmonarytesting shows inability to generate a normal negative inspiratory force during forced inspiration. The abdomen is softand nontender, with increased bowel sounds. Muscle strength is 4/5 diffusely, with severe, continuous, and diffusefasciculations. Deep tendon reflexes are sluggish, but symmetric. Which of the following is the most likely cause of thispatient's weakness?
###Options:
A. Aspiration pneumonia
B. Guillain-Barré syndrome
C. Insufficient dose of prednisone
D. Motor neuron disease
E. Pyridostigmine overdose


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C, Insufficient dose of prednisone. This patient's symptoms of increasing weakness, shortness of breath, abdominal cramping, and inability to generate a normal negative inspiratory force during forced inspiration are suggestive of myasthenia gravis exacerbation. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue due to autoantibodies that target the neuromuscular junction. The patient's symptoms of hypernasality, weak cough, and increased bowel sounds are also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's medications of prednisone andpyridostigmine are commonly used to manage myasthenia gravis, but the patient's symptoms suggest that her myasthenia gravis is not adequately controlled.

The most likely cause of this patient's weakness is an insufficient dose of prednisone. The patient's symptoms of increasing weakness, shortness of breath, abdominal cramping, and inability to generate a normal negative inspiratory force during forced inspiration are suggestive of myasthenia gravis exacerbation. The patient's symptoms of hypernasality, weak cough, and increased bowel sounds are also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's medications of prednisone andpyridostigmine are commonly used to manage myasthenia gravis, but the patient's symptoms suggest that her myasthenia gravis is not adequately controlled.

Aspiration pneumonia is unlikely in this patient as there are no findings of altered mental status or respiratory distress. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms of increasing weakness, shortness of breath, abdominal cramping, and inability to generate a normal negative inspiratory force are not consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Additionally, Guillain-Barré syndrome typically presents with ascending paralysis, which is not seen in this patient. Pyridostigmine overdose is also unlikely as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with pyridostigmine toxicity. Motor neuron disease is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms of increasing weakness, shortness of breath, abdominal cramping, and inability to generate a normal negative inspiratory force are not consistent with motor neuron disease.

The patient's symptoms of increasing weakness, shortness of breath, abdominal cramping, and inability to generate a normal negative inspiratory force are suggestive of myasthenia gravis exacerbation. The patient's symptoms of hypernasality, weak cough, and increased bowel sounds are also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's history of myasthenia gravis, current medications of prednisone andpyridostigmine, and lack of other obvious causes for her symptoms make myasthenia gravis the most likely diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms of increasing weakness, shortness of breath, abdominal cramping, and inability to generate a normal negative inspiratory force are suggestive of myasthenia gravis exacerbation.

###Question: Seven days after admission to the psychiatric unit for treatment of eating disorders, a hospitalized 20-year-old woman has a 2-day history of moderate mouth pain on the inside of both cheeks. She also reports feeling ""worthless and fat."" Fluoxetine was started on admission. She appears distressed. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 77 kg (170 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows bilateral swelling of the parotid and submandibular glands, discoloration of several teeth, and scarring on the dorsum of the right hand. Mental status examination shows no suicidal ideation or intent. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate to treat this patient's current symptoms?
###Options:
A. Binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
B. Binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
C. Inhibition of protein synthesis via binding to 50S ribosomal subunits and preventing peptide bond formation
D. Inhibition of protein synthesis via loss of DNA helical structure
E. Interference with bacterial wall synthesis


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: Inhibition of protein synthesis via binding to 50S ribosomal subunits and preventing peptide bond formation. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. It works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which helps to regulate mood. However, one of the side effects of SSRIs is cheese reaction, which is characterized by the development of swelling and redness of the salivary glands. This is due to the drug's mechanism of action, which is to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, leading to increased levels of the neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. This increased level causes the release of histamine, which can lead to the symptoms seen in the patient. The patient's symptoms of swollen salivary glands, discoloration of teeth, and scarring on her hand are consistent with cheese reaction. The other options do not have this mechanism of action.

###Question: A 60-year-old man presented with severe shortness of breath, excessive sweating and bluish discoloration of the lips. He had a history of chronic smoking. His laboratory results indicated abnormal haematological findings. The patient was diagnosed with severe emphysema. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be observed in this patient?
###Options:
A. Increase in HbA1c level
B. Decrease in white blood cell count
C. Increase in platelet count
D. Polycythemia
E. Decrease in platelet count


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Polycythemia. The patient's symptoms of severe shortness of breath, excessive sweating and bluish discoloration of the lips are indicative of chronic lung disease. The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterized by chronic bronchitis and emphysema. In COPD, the destruction of alveolar walls leads to a decrease in lung compliance and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. This results in pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. The increased pulmonary vascular resistance also leads to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary aerial wedge pressure. This increase in left ventricular afterload leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased left ventricular pressures. The increased left ventricular pressures can lead to increased capillary pressures and increased hydrostatic forces, which can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. The increased hydrostatic forces can also lead to increased capillary permeability and increased oncotic pressure, which can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. The increased hydrostatic forces can also lead to increased capillary pressures and increased oncotic pressure, which can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. The increased hydrostatic forces can also lead to increased capillary permeability and increased oncotic pressure, which can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. The increased hydrostatic forces can also lead to increased capillary pressures and increased oncotic pressure, which can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. The increased hydrostatic forces can also lead to increased capillary permeability and increased oncotic pressure, which can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. The increased hydrostatic forces can also lead to increased capillary pressures and increased oncotic pressure, which can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema.

###Options:
A. Aplastic crisis
B. Splenic sequestration crisis
C. Hemolytic crisis
D. Vaso-occlusive crisis
E. Asymptomatic carrier state


### Response: The correct answer is"," option E, Asymptomatic carrier state. The most common presentation of sickle cell trait in African adults is an asymptomatic carrier state. Sickle cell trait is a condition where an individual is heterozygous for the sickle cell gene (HbS), which is a missense mutation in the b-globin gene. The b-globin gene is located on the sho arm of chromosome 11. The sickle cell gene is recessive, which means an individual must have two copies of the gene (one from each parent) to be affected. The sickle cell trait is a milder form of sickle cell disease. In this condition, the oxygen saturation of the blood is normal, and the red blood cells are not sickle shaped. The most common symptom of sickle cell trait is a positive sickling test. This test is done by adding deoxygenated blood to room temperature and then adding oxygenated blood. The red blood cells of an individual with sickle cell trait will become sickle shaped and stay that way even when oxygenated. The sickling test is negative in individuals with sickle cell disease. The sickling test is also used to differentiate between sickle cell trait and thalassemia trait. In thalassemia trait, the red blood cells will not become sickle shaped even when deoxygenated. The sickling test is also used to determine if an individual is a carrier for sickle cell disease. If the individual has a sickling test that is positive, they should be tested for sickle cell disease. If the sickling test is negative, the individual is not a carrier for sickle cell disease.

###Question: A 28-year-old male patient without any significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with sudden onset paralysis of his extremities. He was normal and able to move his limbs when he went to sleep, but when he woke up, he was not able to move his extremities. He can swallow properly and move his neck; he has normal vision and no difficulty with respiration. He denies pain, paresthesia, or any recent trauma. This is the fourth time in a year he has developed a similar episode of paralysis. The patient is afebrile, with a blood pressure of 122/80 mmHg, a pulse of 80/minute, and a respiratory rate of 14/minute. Cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal examination revealed no abnormality. Neurological examination revealed hypotonia in all extremities and depressed deep tendon reflexes. His sensations are intact. Laboratory work reveals sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 1.9 mEq/L, serum urea nitrogen 18 mEq/L, creatinine 0.8 mEq/L, chloride 110 mEq/L, bicarbonate 26 mEq/L, and creatine kinase 1122 U/L. The acute episode of muscle weakness resolved with oral potassium administration. The patient is ready for discharge. Neurological examination during discharge revealed no abnormality. Which of the following therapeutic measure is appropriate in this patient to prevent recurrent attacks of similar weakness in the future?
###Options:
A. Propanolol
B. Acetazolamide
C. Pyridostigmine
D. Intravenous immune globulin
E. Levo-dopa


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Propanolol. This patient's recurrent episodes of weakness, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia are suggestive of periodic paralysis. This condition is characterized by episodic weakness due to hypokalemia, which can be triggered by exercise, high carbohydrate meals, or emotional stress. The weakness is usually symmetrical and proximal. Episodes can be treated with oral or intravenous potassium replacement. Propanolol is a beta blocker that can be used to prevent recurrent attacks by blocking the effects of catecholamines, which can trigger these episodes.

###Question: You are a fourth year medical student sitting in a spirometry clinic. You take a brief history from the patient, a 44 year old female, before they have spirometry. You find out they have been having problems with their breathing for the last month or so. She previously smoked 30 a day for 'quite a few years', and has not had any exposure to any industrial chemicals or asbestos. They have never had any problems with their breathing in the past. In terms of past medical history, she has previously had severe joint pains, worse in her hands. However she has been on treatment for the last 6 months and this is now much improved. Her spirometry results are as follows: FEV1: 2.0 (Normal for age and height 2.79) FVC: 2.8 (Normal for age and height 3.25) What is the most likely pathology causing these results, taking into account the clinical history?
###Options:
A. Tuberculosis
B. Pulmonary fibrosis
C. COPD
D. Asthma
E. Bronchiectasis


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C COPD. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is reduced, indicating airflow limitation. The forced vital capacity (FVC) is also reduced, indicating airflow limitation. The FEV1/FVC ratio is 0.78, which is within the normal range. The patient's history of smoking and the spirometry results are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The reduced FEV1 and FVC, along with the preserved FEV1/FVC ratio, are consistent with the diagnosis of COPD. COPD is characterized by airflow limitation, which is often irreversible. The airflow limitation is caused by narrowing or obstruction of the bronchi and bronchioles. The severity of COPD is often classified using the GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) classification system. GOLD stage 1 is defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7 and FEV1 >80% predicted. This patient would be classified as GOLD stage 1.

C. Antibiotics will shorten this patient's disease course
D. Young patients generally have a favorable long-term prognosis
E. None


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Young patients generally have a favorable long-term prognosis. This is a case of nephritic syndrome, which is a complication of a rheumatologic disease. The patient's symptoms of swollen ankles and puffy eyes are indicative of edema, which is a sign of increased fluid in the body. The hypertension is likely due to the kidneys' inability to properly filter the blood, leading to increased blood pressure. The elevated creatinine is a sign of kidney damage. The most common cause of nephritic syndrome in children is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is a disease that affects many organs in the body. The disease is more common in developing countries, and the most common symptoms are fever, rash, and joint pain. The disease is more common in females. The most common laboratory finding is decreased C3 levels, which is a sign of complement activation. Antibiotics will not shorten the course of the disease, as it is a rheumatologic disease. The long-term prognosis of nephritic syndrome is generally good, with most patients experiencing full recovery of kidney function.

B. Hyper-IgM syndrome
C. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA)
D. DiGeorge syndrome
E. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). -CVID is the most common clinically significant immunodeficiency disorder in adults. -CVID is characterized by low serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, and variable IgE. -CVID is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple potential etiologies, including autoimmune disease, infection, and genetic defects. -CVID is the most likely diagnosis in this patient given her history of recurrent infections, low serum immunoglobulin levels, and normal serum levels of IgD and IgE. -X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a congenital immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low serum levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes. -XLA is the most common primary immunodeficiency disorder in boys. -XLA is caused by a mutation in the BTK gene, which leads to a deficiency of B-cell tyrosine kinase. -XLA is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood with recurrent bacterial infections. -XLA is unlikely to be the diagnosis in this patient given her age and the absence of recurrent bacterial infections. -Hyper-IgM syndrome is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low serum levels of IgG and IgA, and elevated levels of IgM. -Hyper-IgM syndrome is caused by a mutation in the BTK gene, which leads to a deficiency of B-cell tyrosine kinase. -Hyper-IgM syndrome is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood with recurrent bacterial infections. -Hyper-IgM syndrome is unlikely to be the diagnosis in this patient given her age and the absence of recurrent bacterial infections. -DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital immunodeficiency disorder caused by a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2. -DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by low serum levels of IgA and IgM, and normal or elevated levels of IgG. -DiGeorge syndrome is the most common cause of acquired hypoparathyroidism. -DiGeorge syndrome is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood with hypocalcemic tetany and thymic aplasia. -DiGeorge syndrome is unlikely to be the diagnosis in this patient given her age and the absence of hypocalcemic tetany. -SCID is a congenital immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low serum levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes. -SCID is caused by a mutation in the IL2RG gene, which leads to a deficiency of common gamma chain. -SCID is the most common cause of recurrent severe infections in children. -SCID is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood with recurrent bacterial and viral infections. -SCID is unlikely to be the diagnosis in this patient given her age and the absence of recurrent severe infections.

### Input:
###Question: A 26-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his roommate after he was found staggering towards the living room. He reports dizziness, nausea, confusion, headache, mild chest pain, shortness of breath, and poor balance. He states that he left the heater in his room, running for a couple of hours while working on his project before he experienced these symptoms. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vitals show a temperature of 98.8 F (37.1 C), pulse 96/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 124/86 mmHg. He is afebrile, acyanotic, but appears somnolent. Conjunctival pallor is absent. Clear vesicular breath sounds are noted on auscultation with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. CO-oximeter reveals a carboxyhemoglobin of 15%, while his oxygen saturation on room air is 97%. Which of the following treatment options should be given to the patient?
###Options:
A. 100% supplemental oxygen
B. Succimer
C. Methylene blue
D. Sodium nitrite
E. Sodium valporate


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Methylene blue:

The patient's presentation of symptoms, including confusion, headache, shortness of breath, poor balance, nausea, and chest pain, along with signs of hypoxia (carboxyhemoglobin of 15%), tachycardia (heart rate of 96/min), and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 22/min), is suggestive of methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the presence of methemoglobin in the blood, which impairs oxygen-carrying capacity and can lead to hypoxia and cyanosis. The patient's symptoms of confusion, headache, and dizziness are likely due to the hypoxia caused by the methemoglobinemia. The presence of a coexisting CO poisoning is also significant, as CO can also cause symptoms of hypoxia and cyanosis. The patient's history of running a heater for a prolonged period of time while working on his project is suggestive of carbon monoxide poisoning. The CO-oximeter reading of a carboxyhemoglobin of 15% indicates that the patient is experiencing both methemoglobinemia and carbon monoxide poisoning.

The treatment of choice for methemoglobinemia is intravenous administration of methylene blue, which can reduce the methemoglobin back to normal hemoglobin. Methylene blue acts as a one-electron acceptor, accepting one electron from the ferrous iron in hemoglobin, thereby returning the iron to its normal, non-methemoglobin state. The patient's symptoms of confusion, headache, and dizziness are likely due to the hypoxia caused by the methemoglobinemia. The presence of a coexisting CO poisoning is also significant, as CO can also cause symptoms of hypoxia and cyanosis. The patient's history of running a heater for a prolonged period of time while working on his project is suggestive of carbon monoxide poisoning.

###Question: A 54-year-old woman undergoes urgent preoperative evaluation before resection of a partially obstructing mass in the descending colon. She has lost 9 kg (20 lb) over the past 6 months. Her history includes moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but no known coronary artery disease. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily. Her only medication is a combined ipratropium–albuterol oral inhaler. On physical examination, she appears ill. The blood pressure is normal. Weight is 48.9 kg (108 lb). Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. On cardiopulmonary examination, the lungs are clear, with distant breath sounds and a prolonged expiratory phase, and the heart has a regular rhythm without murmur or gallop. On abdominal examination, high-pitched bowel sounds are heard, and a 6-cm mass, tender to palpation, is detected in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory tests are normal except for a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL (100 g/L) and a serum albumin level of 2.9 g/dL (29 g/L). The chest radiograph shows only changes consistent with COPD, and the electrocardiogram is normal. In addition to routine use of scheduled bronchodilator treatments and supplemental oxygen, which of the following strategies is most appropriate in preventing postoperative pneumonia in this patient?
###Options:
A. Intravenous hyperalimentation
B. Prophylactic corticosteroids
C. Prophylactic antibiotics
D. Incentive spirometry
E. Enteral hyperalimentation


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Incentive spirometry.
In this patient with COPD, the risk factors for postoperative pneumonia include malnutrition (serum albumin level of 2.9 g/dL), weight loss (9 kg over 6 months), and a mass in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen (likely an obstructing colonic mass). All of these factors increase the risk of pneumonia.
Incentive spirometry is a simple and effective measure that can be used in the perioperative period to prevent postoperative pneumonia. It involves breathing deeply and then forcefully through a mouthpiece connected to a vibrating device, which encourages deep inspiration and helps to clear secretions from the airways. It can be performed by the patient at home after discharge from the hospital.
Intravenous hyperalimentation, prophylactic corticosteroids, enteral hyperalimentation, and routine use of scheduled bronchodilator treatments are not indicated in this patient.

###Question: A 79-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain has been occurring intermittently for 3 days. It is not associated with exertion, does not radiate, and is ""dull"" in nature. The physical exam is remarkable for obesity and lower extremity edema. The cardiac exam is normal. Your senior registrar asked you to perfrom an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed a left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient has had several prior ECGs in the past as seen in the documentation in his hospital folder. They all showed LBBB similar to the present one. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
###Options:
A. Call a cardiac alert so the patient can receive an immediate percutaneous coronary intervention
B. Have the patient bear down and repeat the ECG
C. Administer a loading dose of amiodarone to the patient and repeat the ECG
D. Check a serum troponin
E. repeat the ECG after a few hours


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Check a serum troponin. The patient's presentation of chest pain, lower extremity edema, and a history of LBBB on ECG are suggestive of heart failure. The patient's chronic history of LBBB makes him a candidate for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The first step in the evaluation of a patient for CRT is to determine if the patient has a wide QRS complex on ECG. If the patient does not have a wide QRS complex, the patient would not be a candidate for CRT. Therefore, the next step is to determine if the patient has a wide QRS complex on the ECG. This can be done by checking the QRS duration on the ECG. If the QRS duration is greater than 150 milliseconds, the patient would be a candidate for CRT. If the QRS duration is less than 150 milliseconds, the patient would not be a candidate for CRT.

### Input:
###Question: A 40-year-old man presents with hearing loss in his right ear. Past medical history is significant for type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Vital signs heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and temperature 98.6° F (37° C). On physical examination, the ear canals are clear, and tympanic membranes pearly grey bilaterally. A tuning fork test is performed by placing the tuning fork on the vertex, and the patient states he hears better in the affected ear. What is the underlying cause of this patient’s hearing loss?
###Options:
A. Labyrinthitis
B. Meniere disease
C. Otosclerosis
D. Otomycosis
E. Noise exposure


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Labyrinthitis, which is inflammation of the inner ear. Labyrinthitis can be caused by a number of factors, including viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and exposure to loud noise or ototoxic medications. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension is also significant for diabetic neuropathy and microvascular disease, which can lead to hearing loss.

Option B, Meniere disease, is less likely in this case because the patient's hearing loss is unilateral, which is not typical of Meniere disease, which is typically bilateral.

Option C, Otosclerosis, is less likely in this case because the patient's hearing loss is unilateral, which is not typical of otosclerosis, which is typically bilateral.

Option D, Otomycosis, is less likely in this case because the patient's hearing loss is unilateral, which is not typical of otomycosis, which is typically bilateral.

###Question: Which of the following is the primary mechanism responsible for the development of atherosclerosis? 
###Options:
A. Endothelial dysfunction
B. Smooth muscle cell proliferation
C. Lipoprotein oxidation
D. Platelet aggregation
E. Inflammation


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A, Endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is the primary mechanism responsible for the development of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall caused by the accumulation of lipoprotein and inflammatory cells in the intima. The endothelium is the first layer of the vessel wall to be affected by atherosclerosis. The endothelium normally produces nitric oxide (NO), which is a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In atherosclerosis, the endothelium is damaged, and the production of NO is reduced. This allows the smooth muscle cells to proliferate and accumulate in the intima. The smooth muscle cells produce matrix proteins that form the plaque. The oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Oxidized LDL binds to the endothelium and is taken up by the smooth muscle cells, which accumulate lipid-laden macrophages. The macrophages in the plaque are known as foam cells. Platelet aggregation is not a direct cause of atherosclerosis, but it does contribute to the formation of thrombi that can cause acute coronary syndromes.

###Options:
A. Phlyctenular conjunctivitis
B. Mucopurulent conjunctivitis
C. Bulbar spring catarrh
D. Purulent conjunctivitis
E. Adenoviral conjunctivitis


### Response: The correct answer is"," C. Bulbar spring catarrh. The boy is suffering from Bulbar spring catarrh. The condition is characterized by mucopurulent conjunctivitis with mucous nodules on the limbus. The mucopurulent conjunctivitis is associated with a marked hyperophy of the papillae of the conjunctiva and ciliary body. The mucous nodules on the limbus are composed of epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. The condition is usually bilateral and chronic. The disease is caused by the presence of a mucopurulent discharge that is not effectively washed away by the normal tear flow. The mucopurulent discharge acts as an irritant and causes the epithelial cells to proliferate and form the mucous nodules. The mucous nodules may be seen on the limbus or on the bulbar conjunctiva. The mucopurulent conjunctivitis is associated with a marked hyperophy of the papillae of the conjunctiva and ciliary body. The mucous nodules on the limbus are composed of epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. The condition is usually bilateral and chronic. The disease is caused by the presence of a mucopurulent discharge that is not effectively washed away by the normal tear flow. The mucopurulent discharge acts as an irritant and causes the epithelial cells to proliferate and form the mucous nodules.

He takes no medications and denies the use of alcohol, illicit substances, and tobacco products. The patient is self-employed as a painter and admits to not always using protective equipment. Vital signs are unremarkable. Physical exam reveals a well-developed man with conjunctival pallor, mild oozing in the buccal mucosa, and petechiae over his bilateral lower extremities. Labs are notable for hemoglobin 5.1 g/dL, platelets 30 K/microliter, and white blood cells 1.0 K/microliter with 40% neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Dyskeratosis congenita
B. Aplastic anemia
C. Diamond-Blackfan anemia
D. Fanconi anemia
E. None


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D Fanconi anemia. This patient's presentation is consistent with Fanconi anemia, a disorder characterized by a defect in DNA repair, resulting in bone marrow failure. The patient's history of easy bruising, fatigue, and frequent infections is indicative of pancytopenia, a condition in which there is a decrease in all three blood cell lineages (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). The patient's low hemoglobin, low platelets, and low white blood cell count are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of conjunctival pallor, oral mucosal petechiae, and skin petechiae are also indicative of aplastic anemia, a similar condition characterized by bone marrow failure. However, the patient's age of 35 and lack of family history of similar symptoms make Fanconi anemia the more likely diagnosis.

###Question: A 65-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with an inability to move either of his lower extremities and loss of pain and temperature sensation below his waist. His symptoms came on suddenly approximately 3 hours ago. A full neurologic examination shows 0/5 power in both lower extremities, but his proprioceptive and fine touch sensations are normal. However, after an hour in the emergency department, he begins to complain of suprapubic discomfort, and an overly distended bladder is discovered on ultrasound. Which of the following additional complications
###Options:
A. Tachycardia
B. Ankle clonus
C. Hoffman sign
D. Hypotension
E. bradycardia


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Hypotension. The patient's symptoms of sudden onset paralysis, loss of pain and temperature sensation below the waist, and bladder distention are suggestive of cauda equina syndrome, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention. Cauda equina syndrome is a neurologic condition that occurs when there is compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equina, which are the exiting nerve roots from the spinal cord at the level of the lower end of the spinal cord. This compression can be caused by a variety of factors, including herniated disc, spinal stenosis, tumor, trauma, and infection. The compression of these nerve roots causes a loss of motor function, loss of sensation, and autonomic dysfunction. The resulting clinical picture is one of acute onset paralysis, bladder dysfunction, and loss of bowel and sexual function. The most common complication of cauda equina syndrome is hypotension, which occurs in up to 50% of patients. This is thought to be due to the autonomic dysfunction that occurs with the compression of the nerve roots. The other listed options are not typical complications of cauda equina syndrome. Tachycardia is a compensatory response to hypotension, and ankle clonus is a sign of spinal cord injury, not cauda equina syndrome. Hoffman sign is a sign of spinal cord injury, not cauda equina syndrome.

###Options:
A. An acute coronary syndrome
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Pneumonia
D. Apical ballooning cardiomyopathy
E. Myocarditis


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A, an acute coronary syndrome. The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, worsened by deep inspiration, are suggestive of angina pectoris. The ECG findings of pan-anterior T wave inversion are also consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. The elevated troponin level of 1.5 (upper normal limit, 0.05) is also indicative of myocardial injury.

Option B, Pulmonary embolism, is unlikely as there are no risk factors or clinical findings to suggest this diagnosis. The patient's oxygen saturation of 95% is within normal limits, and there is no evidence of right-sided heart strain on examination. Option C, Pneumonia, is unlikely as there are no clinical findings to suggest this diagnosis. The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal limits, and there is no evidence of consolidation on examination. Option D, Apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, is unlikely as there are no clinical findings to suggest this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, worsened by deep inspiration, are not consistent with the typical presentation of apical ballooning cardiomyopathy. The ECG findings of pan-anterior T wave inversion are not typical of apical ballooning cardiomyopathy. The elevated troponin level of 1.5 (upper normal limit, 0.05) is not consistent with apical ballooning cardiomyopathy.

Option E, Myocarditis, is also unlikely as there are no clinical findings to suggest this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, worsened by deep inspiration, are not typical of myocarditis.

### Input:
###Question: A 4-year-old boy develops fever 3 weeks after being admitted to the hospital for induction chemotherapy for treatmentof acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chemotherapy medications are L-asparaginase, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, andvincristine. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 122/min, and respirations are 24/min. Physical examinationshows pallor, alopecia, and ulcerations over the gums. A central venous catheter with entry site in the right upper chestis present but has no surrounding erythema. A blood culture grows gram-negative rods after 36 hours. Which of thefollowing underlying mechanisms is the most likely cause of this patient's susceptibility to infection?
###Options:
A. (A) Deficiency of terminal complement
B. Hypogammaglobulinemia
C. Impaired T-lymphocyte function
D. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α functio
E. Neutropenia


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option E: Neutropenia. This patient's neutropenia is a likely cause of his susceptibility to infection. Neutropenia is a condition characterized by a low number of neutrophils in the blood, which are a type of white blood cell that is responsible for fighting off infections. In this case, the patient's chemotherapy medications, including L-asparaginase, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and vincristine, are likely causing a decrease in the number of neutrophils in the blood. These medications work by destroying rapidly dividing cells, including immature white blood cells in the bone marrow that give rise to neutrophils.

In addition, the central venous catheter with an entry site in the right upper chest is also a likely cause of the patient's susceptibility to infection. Catheters can disrupt the normal function of the immune system by introducing bacteria or other substances into the bloodstream. This can lead to a decrease in neutrophils, making the patient more susceptible to infections.

The other options listed, Deficiency of terminal complement, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Impaired T-lymphocyte function, and Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α function, are not likely causes of the patient's susceptibility to infection. Deficiency of terminal complement and impaired T-lymphocyte function can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections, but they are not directly related to the patient's neutropenia or central venous catheter. Hypogammaglobulinemia and inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α function are not associated with neutropenia.

###Options:
A. nocturnal episodes
B. orthopnea
C. all of the above
D. none of the above
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," 'c' i.e., All of the above Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is a symptom of congestive hea failure. It is defined as the occurrence of dyspnea at rest or with minimal exeion, and its onset at night, especially in the later pa of the night. The most common cause of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is congestive hea failure. Other causes include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pleural effusion. The most common cause of congestive hea failure is ischemic hea disease. The most common cause of ischemic hea disease is coronary aery disease. The most common cause of coronary aery disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the inner lining of the aeries. It is caused by the buildup of plaques made up of cholesterol and other substances. The buildup of plaques narrows the aery, reducing blood flow to the hea muscle. The most common symptom of congestive hea failure is dyspnea. Dyspnea is the sensation of difficulty breathing. It is a symptom of many conditions, both cardiac and non-cardiac in origin. The most common cause of dyspnea in congestive hea failure is fluid build-up in the lungs. The fluid build-up occurs because the hea is not pumping enough blood to meet the body's needs. The fluid build-up causes the lungs to swell, making it harder for them to function. Other causes of dyspnea in congestive hea failure include reduced oxygen supply to the lungs and reduced oxygen supply to the hea muscle. The reduced oxygen supply causes the muscle to work harder to get enough oxygen. The harder the muscle works, the more breathless a person feels. Other symptoms of congestive hea failure include fatigue, weakness, and a feeling of tightness in the chest. The most common cause of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is congestive hea failure.

###Question: A 4-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus is brought to the emergency department by her father because of a 4-hourepisode of restlessness, sweating, and confusion that occurred during the night. Yesterday, he allowed her to eat cupcakesand cotton candy at a county fair. At her bedtime that evening, he increased her dose of subcutaneous intermediateacting and long-acting insulin. Her symptoms began 6 hours later, then resolved spontaneously. After being informedthis morning of this nighttime episode, the mother insisted the father bring the patient to the hospital. On arrival, thepatient is alert. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her fingerstick bloodglucose concentration is 72 mg/dL. Urinalysis is negative for glucose and ketones. Which of the following is the mostlikely explanation for this patient's nighttime symptoms?
###Options:
A. Hyperglycemia caused by increased glucose consumption
B. Hyperglycemia caused by increased glycogen metabolism
C. Hyperglycemia caused by insufficient exogenous insulin
D. Hypoglycemia caused by excess exogenous insulin
E. Hypoglycemia caused by excessive renal glucose loss


### Response: The correct answer is"," option D: Hypoglycemia caused by excessive renal glucose loss. This patient's symptoms of restlessness, sweating, and confusion, along with a low fingerstick blood glucose concentration, are indicative of hypoglycemia. The most likely cause of her hypoglycemia is excessive renal glucose loss, as indicated by the negative urinalysis for glucose and ketones. This is a common problem in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, especially if they consume a lot of carbohydrates and have a large glycogen stores. The increased insulin dose that the patient's father administered before bedtime was likely responsible for promoting glycogenolysis and glucose reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to excessive renal glucose loss and subsequent hypoglycemia.

###Question: A 7-year-old boy presents for fever, chills, vomiting, and a rash. The child had been in good health until two days ago when he complained of a sore throat and pain when swallowing. The rash appeared today. There is no history of cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, or conjunctivitis. All his vaccinations are up to date. His temperature is 101 F (38.3 C), blood pressure 110/76 mm/Hg, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and heart rate 120 beats/min. Examination of the pharynx reveals erythematous, enlarged tonsils covered with a yellowish exudate. The tongue appears enlarged and erythematous with edematous papillae on the surface. The anterior cervical lymph nodes are swollen and tender bilaterally. Skin examination reveals flushed cheeks with circumoral pallor and a diffuse, blanching maculopapular rash with a sandpaper texture. The axillary folds and flexural surfaces are markedly erythematous. What is the most likely pathophysiological mechanism responsible for this patient’s condition?
###Options:
A. Exotoxin-mediated reaction
B. Immunologic cross-reactivity
C. Direct viral tropism
D. Endotoxin-mediated reaction
E. None of the above


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B Immunologic cross-reactivity. This patient's presentation is consistent with a viral pharyngitis complicated by a post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to streptococcal antigens that cross-react with host tissues. The most common causative organism is group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, also known as Streptococcus pyogenes. The cross-reactive antigens are the M protein and the C-terminal of the group-specific carbohydrate (GAC). The M protein is a virulence factor that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that can then attack host tissues. The C-terminal of the GAC is a cell wall component that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that can then attack host tissues. The antibodies produced in response to the streptococcal antigens can then attack host tissues, leading to the symptoms of PSGN.

The symptoms of PSGN typically appear 1-4 weeks after the onset of a streptococcal infection. The most common symptoms are fever, rash, and joint pain. The rash is usually a diffuse, blanching maculopapular rash. The rash can also appear in the palms and soles, sparing the face. The joint pain is typically migratory, involving both large and small joints. The joints can also be swollen. Other symptoms can include headache, abdominal pain, and respiratory symptoms.

The pathophysiology of PSGN involves the immune system attacking the glomeruli of the kidneys. The antibodies produced in response to the streptococcal antigens can cross-react with host tissues, specifically basement membrane antigens in the glomeruli. The antibodies attack the basement membrane, causing damage and inflammation. The damage to the glomeruli leads to proteinuria, which is the presence of protein in the urine. The inflammation also causes hematuria, which is the presence of blood in the urine. The symptoms of PSGN typically peak around day 7-10 and can persist for up to 4-6 weeks.

The treatment for PSGN is supportive. The mainstay of treatment is fluid resuscitation and close monitoring of renal function. The use of corticosteroids is controversial, but may be considered in patients with severe renal involvement or nephritic syndrome. Antibiotics are not typically used in the treatment of PSGN, as the primary pathophysiology is an immune-mediated response to streptococcal antigens.

###Question: A 45-year-old man collapses at home and is brought to accident and emergency. He has a fever at 39.5°C and blood pressure is 90/60mmHg, although he is in a lucid state. Bruises can be seen on his skin which he remembers being present before he fell. Blood tests show the patient to have a normocytic anaemia with a low platelet count and increased fibrin split products. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A. Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
B. Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
C. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation
E. Thalassemia minor


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) DIC is a condition characterised by widespread activation of the clotting system, leading to intravascular coagulation and consumption of platelets and fibrin split products. It is often seen in association with severe infections, such as the one described in the question. The condition is characterised by a low platelet count, increased fibrin split products and normocytic anaemia. The presence of bruises on the skin, which the patient remembers having, is due to the formation of purpura fulminans, a condition which is associated with DIC. Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (choice A) is characterised by a positive direct antiglobulin test and is associated with a reticulocytosis, which is not seen in this patient. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (choice C) is characterised by the presence of intravascular haemolysis and thrombosis, which is not seen in this patient. Thalassemia minor (choice E) is characterised by mild anaemia, but no thrombocytopenia or increased fibrin split products.

###Question: Management of a patient with threatened abortion includes all of the following,
EXCEPT:



###Options:
A. Ultrasound
B. Physical examination
C. CBC
D. Derailed menstrual history
E. Dilatation and curettage


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. Dilatation and curettage. Threatened abortion is defined as vaginal bleeding in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy with a closed cervix and a mobile uterus. It is a common gynecologic complaint. The patient is usually young and often has her first pregnancy. The most common cause is a uterine structural anomaly such as a bicornuate uterus. The patient usually has a history of a missed period and presents with lower abdominal cramping and spotting.

The initial evaluation should include a complete history and physical examination. A complete blood count (CBC) may be helpful if the patient is anemic. A pregnancy test should be performed to document a closed cervix. A transvaginal ultrasound is the most accurate test to determine the location of the products of conception. The uterus should be carefully palpated to determine if it is soft and mobile.

The treatment of threatened abortion is controversial. Many physicians will observe the patient and treat with bed rest and analgesics. Others will recommend a course of progesterone. Some physicians will recommend dilatation and curettage (D&C). The goal of treatment is to prevent the passage of products of conception through the internal os.

D&C is usually reserved for patients with a confirmed pregnancy and a closed cervical os. The patient should be monitored closely with a pregnancy test and a vaginal examination. If the products of conception are not expelled within 48 hours, a D&C should be performed.

The patient should be counseled that the products of conception may be retained in the uterus for an additional 48 hours. If the products of conception are not expelled within 72 hours, a D&C should be performed.

The patient should be informed that the products of conception may be retained in the uterus for an additional 72 hours. If the products of conception are not expelled within 72 hours, a D&C should be performed.

The patient should be informed that the products of conception may be retained in the uterus for an additional 96 hours. If the products of conception are not expelled within 96 hours, a D&C should be performed.

The patient should be informed that the products of conception may be retained in the uterus for an additional 120 hours. If the products of conception are not expelled within 120 hours, a D&C should be performed.

The patient should be informed that the products of conception may be retained in the uterus for an additional 144 hours. If the products of conception are not expelled within 144 hours, a D&C should be performed.

###Question: A 66-year-old man who was recently diagnosed with Parkinson disease comes to the physician for a follow-upexamination. Carbidopa-levodopa therapy was initiated at the time of diagnosis. The patient tells the physician that hestill has episodes during which he ""freezes."" He has a clumsy gait, and there is rigidity of his upper extremities andhands. An adjunct therapy designed to inhibit which of the following enzymes is most likely indicated in this patient?
###Options:
A. Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase
B. Dopamine β-hydroxylase
C. Monoamine oxidase B
D. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
E. Tyrosine hydroxylase


### Response: The correct answer is"," E. Tyrosine hydroxylase. The patient is exhibiting signs of Parkinson disease, which is characterized by a decrease in dopamine levels in the brain. The standard treatment for Parkinson disease is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa, which increases dopamine levels in the brain. However, the patient is still experiencing ""freezing"" episodes, which is a sign of motor fluctuations. Motor fluctuations are common in patients with Parkinson disease and are a result of the medication's ability to increase dopamine levels in the brain during ""on"" periods, which can result in decreased symptoms. An adjunct therapy designed to inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the production of levodopa, is most likely indicated in this patient. This would help regulate the dopamine levels in the brain and prevent the ""freezing"" episodes.

Which of the following tests is most likely to diagnose this patient's condition?
###Options:
A. Lumbar puncture
B. CT head
C. Brain MRI
D. Electroencephalogram
E. Skull Xrat


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Lumbar puncture. This patient's altered mental status, subjective fevers, nausea, vomiting, and right-sided weakness are all suggestive of an infectious process. The most likely diagnosis in this case is cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common and serious infection in patients with AIDS. Lumbar puncture is the most appropriate test to perform in this patient to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. This fluid can be analyzed for opening pressure, glucose, cell count, and other parameters. CSF is also used to perform cryptococcal antigen testing, which is a highly sensitive and specific test for cryptococcal infection.

###Question: A 65-year-old man complains of dyspnea that has worsened over the past three years. He limits his physical activity to avoid dyspneic episodes. He denies any chest pain, shoulder pain, or jaw numbness. He has hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. He has a smoking history of 50 pack-years. His blood pressure in the clinic is currently 165/95 mmHg with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. He is obese and has bilateral wheezing and increased anteroposterior chest diameter. Which of the following medications can help alleviate this patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A. Clonidine
B. Lisinopril
C. Ipratropium
D. Atropine
E. Propanolol


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B, Lisinopril. This patient's symptoms are suggestive of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is characterized by dyspnea on exertion, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a prominent RV impulse with a loud first hea sound. The most common cause of HFpEF is aging, and the prevalence increases with age. The treatment of HFpEF is primarily focused on addressing the underlying causes and comorbidities, as well as medication therapy. The most common comorbidities associated with HFpEF are hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The most common medication used in HFpEF is a diuretic, which helps to reduce fluid overload and decrease symptoms. In this patient's case, the symptoms are likely due to HFpEF, as evidenced by his advanced age, hypertension, and physical exam findings of bilateral wheezing and increased anteroposterior chest diameter. The mainstay of treatment for HFpEF is lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, weight reduction, and optimization of blood pressure and diabetes control. In patients with HFpEF, beta blockers have been shown to improve symptoms and decrease hospitalizations, but they are not first-line therapy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is lisinopril, a medication that is commonly used in the management of hypertension and heart failure. It is a ACE inhibitor that has been shown to improve symptoms and decrease hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF.

###Options:
A. Maternal SOX1 deletion
B. Maternal UBE3A mutation
C. Paternal disomy
D. Paternal UBE3A deletion

### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Early-onset Alzheimer disease. This is a case of a patient with memory loss and word-finding difficulties, which are classic symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The patient's history of successful bariatric surgery and weight loss is also indicative of Alzheimer's disease, as weight loss and memory loss are often associated with the disease. The patient's difficulty in repeating 2 of 10 words in a 10-minute recollection test is also indicative of Alzheimer's disease, as this test is used to assess episodic memory, which is often impaired in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

###Question: An 80-year-old woman, with a medical history including diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and mild cognitive impairment/minor neurocognitive disorder, undergoes elective hip replacement surgery due to disabling osteoarthritis. Two days post-surgery, she exhibits signs of agitation, attempting to strike nursing staff attending to her care, while refusing food and medications. She expresses delusions of being poisoned by the nursing staff. Notably, her confusion exacerbates at night but improves by morning. Throughout the following day, she experiences periods of drowsiness and confusion, with increased agitation and aggressiveness in the late afternoon. According to her family, she exhibited occasional forgetfulness prior to the surgery but was otherwise able to function normally. What is the most probable diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Hypoglycemia-induced confusion
B. Medication-induced psychosis
C. Acute delirium
D. Postoperative delirium
E. Exacerbation of vascular dementia


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: Acute delirium.

The patient's presentation of acute onset of confusion, agitation, and hallucinations (attempting to strike nursing staff) following hip replacement surgery is suggestive of an acute delirium. This is further supported by her fluctuating cognitive symptoms throughout the day, with periods of drowsiness and confusion followed by increased agitation and aggressiveness in the late afternoon.

The confusion exacerbates at night but improves by morning, which is characteristic of a subtype of delirium called the mixed or fluctuating state. This is often seen in patients with an underlying predisposition, such as those with pre-existing cognitive impairment or those undergoing major surgery.

The most likely cause of the patient's confusion is the use of opioids for pain management after the surgery. Opioids can cause respiratory depression and sedation, which can contribute to the development of delirium. The patient's agitation and aggression towards nursing staff may be a response to the opioid use, as opioids can cause psychomotor agitation.

The patient's cognitive symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of delirium, which is characterized by acute changes in attention, memory, language, and/or perception. The patient's agitation, aggression, and attempts to strike nursing staff are classic signs of delirium.

B. Ketamine
C. LSD
D. Phencyclidine
E. Weed


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Ecstasy. This patient's symptoms of euphoria, hyperactivity, and talking about his planned space trip to the moon are indicative of a stimulant intoxication. Ecstasy, also known as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is a synthetic drug that works by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin in the brain. It is commonly used at rave and party events and can cause symptoms like the ones described in the patient.

###Question: A 31-year-old man presents with 3 weeks of worsening memory, loss of concentration, and aggressive behavior. His history is significant for HIV and he is prescribed antiretroviral therapy, but his girlfriend is unsure if he takes other prophylactic medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.6 C (99.4 F), blood pressure 118/80 mm Hg, and heart rate 102 bpm. The patient appears mildly confused. Neuropsychological testing reports poor language skills, attention deficit, mild retrograde amnesia, and poor recall. His CD4 count is 75 cells/mm3. A brain MRI reveals cerebral atrophy and patchy white matter hyperintensity. What is the most likely cause of this patient's neurocognitive decline?
###Options:
A. Myelopathy
B. Aseptic meningitis
C. AIDS dementia complex
D. Peripheral neuropathy
E. Early-onset Alzheimer's


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C: AIDS dementia complex.

###Question: An 18-month-old boy who has been exclusively breastfed since birth is found to have soft skull bones and bossing during a routine exam. An x-ray of his right hand shows widening of the epiphyseal plate, and lab results confirm a vitamin deficiency. Which of the following organs is involved in the activation pathway of the deficient vitamin?
###Options:
A. Kidney
B. Pancreas
C. Bone marrow
D. Lungs
E. heart


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B: Pancreas. The deficient vitamin is likely to be vitamin D, and the organ involved in the activation pathway of vitamin D is the pancreas. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, and it is activated in the liver and kidneys. The active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) is then released into the circulation and travels to the kidneys, where it is stored. The kidneys release active vitamin D into the bloodstream when necessary, and it is then sent to the liver, where it is inactivated to its storage form. The pancreas is involved in the final steps of vitamin D activation, specifically the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. This is the final step in the activation pathway of vitamin D. Deficiency of vitamin D can lead to rickets in children, characterized by soft skull bones and bossing. The other organs listed are not involved in the activation pathway of vitamin D.

###Options:
A. Increased platelet count
B. Decreased white blood cell count
C. Presence of blast cells in peripheral blood smear
D. Elevated haemoglobin level
E. Decreased haemoglobin level


### Response: The correct answer is"," option C: Presence of blast cells in peripheral blood smear. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy of the lymphoid lineage of immature B and T cells. It is the most common malignancy of childhood. The diagnosis of ALL is based on the presence of a leukemoid reaction, which is characterized by an increased number of blast cells in the peripheral blood smear. The leukemoid reaction is the result of increased proliferation of immature lymphoblasts in the bone marrow. The peripheral blood smear is often used as a screening test for leukemia. The peripheral blood smear is also useful in the follow-up of patients with leukemia after treatment. The peripheral blood smear is also useful in the diagnosis of other hematologic diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. The peripheral blood smear is also useful in the diagnosis of non-hematologic diseases, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in which the peripheral blood smear may show fragmented red blood cells, and in the diagnosis of vitamin deficiencies, in which the peripheral blood smear may show macrocytic red blood cells.

###Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the outpatient department by his parents due to snoring during his sleep. They state that his snoring has progressively gotten worse over three months. They have also noticed that their son randomly stops breathing during the night. These episodes of absent breathing last 10 to 15 seconds before he gasps and resumes his normal breathing. They also claim that their child has become more irritable and less social over the past few months. He has no significant past medical history other than the occasional sore throat and flu. His family history is positive for diabetes mellitus type 1 in an elder brother and diabetes mellitus type 2 in his father. His vaccinations are up to date, and his vital signs are normal. On examination, the abdomen is soft and non-tender with no organomegaly, S1 and S2 are audible with no added sounds, and the pulse has a normal volume, character, and rhythm. Examination of the head and neck reveals enlarged tonsils. What is the best diagnostic modality for this disease?
###Options:
A. Polysomnography
B. MRI of the chest
C. CT scan of the head and neck
D. Fasting blood sugar level
E. chear x-ray


### Response: The correct answer is"," option A Polysomnography. This is the best diagnostic modality for this disease. The symptoms described in the case, such as snoring, pauses in breathing, irritability, and social withdrawal, are suggestive of sleep apnea, which is a breathing disorder that affects children. Sleep apnea is characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to intermittent arousals from sleep and subsequent sleep fragmentation. The most common form of sleep apnea in children is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is often associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, which is a common finding in young children. The gold standard diagnostic test for OSA is polysomnography, which can objectively measure the breathing during sleep and the associated arousals. This test involves the use of multiple electrodes to monitor brain wave changes, eye movements, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and other physiological parameters. The results of the polysomnography in this case would help to confirm the diagnosis of OSA and determine the severity of the disease. Treatment for OSA in children involves either adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Adenotonsillectomy is the surgical removal of the adenoids and tonsils, which are the main sites of obstruction in OSA.

D. Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, progresses to urinary bladder cancer
E. Caused by Candida albicans, progresses to interstitial cystitis and hematuria


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Caused by Schistosoma haematobium, progresses to bladder wall fibrosis and calcification.Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by trematode flukes belonging to the genus Schistosoma. The most common species infecting humans is Schistosoma haematobium, which is endemic in Africa, the Middle East, and South America. Infection with this species typically occurs in freshwater bodies where the intermediate host, the snail, is present. The parasite then penetrates the skin of the person who comes in contact with the water. The adult worms then migrate to the venous plexus surrounding the urinary bladder, where they lay eggs. The eggs then hatch into larvae, which mature into adult worms. The adult worms then migrate back to the venous plexus surrounding the bladder, where they lay eggs. The eggs then hatch into larvae, which mature into adult worms. This life cycle is repeated for the lifetime of the worms.In the African context, the etiology of bladder schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma haematobium, and it typically progresses to bladder wall fibrosis and calcification. The most common symptoms of bladder schistosomiasis include dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, and hematuria. The most serious complication of bladder schistosomiasis is squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.

###Question: A 30-year-old woman presents with malaise and increasing fatigue.Physical examination finds a yellow-tinge to her skin and sclera, and laboratory evaluation finds elevated serum liver enzymes. After further workup, the diagnosis of viral hepatitis is made. This workup included a liverbiopsy, which revealed scattered, eosinophilic cells (Councilman bodies),but very little inflammation was present. These Councilman bodies wereformed by an active process that characteristically lacks an inflammatoryresponse and results from the activation of genes that forms new enzymes,such as endonucleases. These enzymes subsequently destroy the cell itself.Which of the following terms best describes this process?
###Options:
A. Apoptosis
B. Autophagy
C. Heterophagy
D. Metaplasia
E. Necrosis


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option E Necrosis. Councilman bodies are a classic example of necrosis, specifically apoptosis. Apoptosis is a process that selectively removes unwanted cells, such as damaged or infected cells, from multicellular organisms. It is a tightly regulated process that involves enzymatic destruction of the cell's nuclear DNA and cytoplasmic organelles. The process is initiated by caspase activation, which cleaves proteins that are essential for cell survival. Cleavage of these proteins leads to activation of enzymes that induce apoptosis. The process is orchestrated by a cascade of molecular events that result in characteristic cell changes, such as cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, and chromatin condensation. The Councilman bodies seen in this case are a result of this apoptotic process.

###Question: A 68-year-old man presents with generalized fatigue and malaise for the last 6 months. A history of present illness reveals low-grade intermittent fever, anorexia, and unintentional weight loss of 10 lb (4.5 kg) with a left upper abdomen fullness. Eight months ago, he was sick for a week with fever, chills, night sweats, myalgia, and chest pain. His symptoms resolved in a week. His medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He is married & lives with his wife. He denies any substance use disorder and is monogamous. There is no history of recent travel or hospitalization history. He complies with his medications. He is active and exercises regularly. He lives in a city suburb near a dairy farm. His vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals hepatosplenomegaly and clubbing of his fingers. The WBC count is 14000/μL, and the platelet count is 120000/μL. Blood urea nitrogen is 30mg/dL, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 60 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 70 units/L, alkaline phosphatase 150 IU/L, and total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL. His hemoglobin A1c is 7.5%. Urinalysis demonstrates microscopic hematuria. ESR is 100 mm/h, and CRP is 24 mg/L. Chest x-ray shows no acute changes. Blood cultures reveal no growth. The results of a transesophageal echocardiogram are normal. Which of the following tests will reveal the diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Repeat blood cultures
B. Viral cell culture
C. Viral hepatitis panel
D. Indirect immunofluorescent test
E. direct immunofluorescent test


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: direct immunofluorescent test. The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly are suggestive of an infectious process. However, blood cultures were negative, and there is no evidence of an immunocompromised state. The presence of hematuria and elevated liver enzymes suggests liver involvement. The patient's history of fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly is suggestive of an infectious process. The patient's history of dairy farm exposure and symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss are consistent with chronic Q fever. Chronic Q fever is often associated with endocarditis, which can explain the patient's positive blood cultures. The diagnosis of chronic Q fever is often made by serologic testing. The indirect immunofluorescent test (Option A) is a screening test for antibodies against Coxiella burnetii. The direct immunofluorescent test (Option D) is a confirmatory test for the presence of antibodies against Coxiella burnetii. The patient's positive indirect immunofluorescent test confirms the diagnosis of chronic Q fever.

###Question: A 17-year-old girl arrives at the emergency department with numbness and tingling in her left hand. She was at a party where she consumed large quantities of alcohol last night and woke up in a chair with these symptoms. She claims never to have had these symptoms before and wants to know if she broke her arm while intoxicated. The patient has no notable medical history, and vitals are within normal limits. She appears diaphoretic and anxious. Physical exam shows no trauma, tenderness, rash, or swelling to the upper extremity, but there is a single well-demarcated red mark on the posterior aspect of the arm. Upon closer inspection, the healthcare provider notices that the symptoms are limited to the fifth and medial fourth digits, and there is tenderness to palpation of the wrist. The involved nerve innervates which of the following muscles?
###Options:
A. Pronator teres
B. Triceps brachii
C. Biceps brachii
D. Flexor carpi ulnaris
E. Palmaris longus


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option C Biceps brachii, so the analysis is

The symptoms described in the case, including numbness and tingling in the fifth and medial fourth digits, along with tenderness to palpation of the wrist, are suggestive of a possible compartment syndrome. This syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a muscle compartment impairs blood flow and nutrient delivery to the muscle, leading to muscle damage. The symptoms are limited to the muscles innervated by the involved nerve, which in this case is the musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6, and C7). The symptoms are also consistent with the anatomical location of the involved nerve and muscle, as the musculocutaneous nerve innervates the biceps brachii, which is located in the anterior compartment of the arm.

The pronator teres is innervated by the median nerve, which is not involved in the patient's symptoms. The triceps brachii is innervated by the radial nerve, which is not involved in the patient's symptoms. The flexor carpi ulnaris is innervated by the ulnar nerve, which is not involved in the patient's symptoms. The palmaris longus is innervated by the median nerve, which is not involved in the patient's symptoms.

His past medical history includes a 20-year history of heavy cigarette smoking. On auscultation, there are decreased breath sounds and crackles at both lung bases. What is the most likely pathological finding in this patient?
###Options:
A. Pulmonary thromboembolism
B. Interstitial fibrosis
C. Goblet cell hyperplasia
D. COPD with emphysema
E. Lung cancer


### Response: The correct answer is"," D. The patient's clinical presentation of chronic cough, dyspnea, and productive sputum, along with the auscultatory findings of decreased breath sounds and crackles, is highly suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with emphysema. Emphysema is characterized by destruction of the alveolar walls, leading to air trapping and airflow obstruction. The other choices do not fit the clinical picture. Pulmonary thromboembolism typically presents with sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and a history of deep venous thrombosis. Interstitial fibrosis is characterized by scarring of the lung parenchyma, leading to restrictive lung disease. Goblet cell hyperplasia is seen in bronchial asthma. Lung cancer typically presents with a history of chronic cough, weight loss, and hemoptysis.

Clinically, he demonstrates moist mucous membranes and normal skin turgor. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. What is the next best step?
###Options:
A. Antiemetic medications and ORT
B. Check a CBC and CMP
C. CT abdomen
D. Obtain stool studies and prescribe antibiotics
E. ABdominal Uss


### Response: The correct answer is"," A: Antiemetic medications and ORT. This patient's presentation is consistent with acute gastroenteritis, likely due to a viral or bacterial infection. The most common viral pathogens implicated in acute gastroenteritis are rotavirus, norovirus, and enteric adenovirus. The most common bacterial pathogens implicated in acute gastroenteritis are Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Clostridium difficile. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with a history of consumption of 'amala' and 'ewedu', suggest an infectious etiology. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with mild symptoms, and he does not have any signs of severe illness or toxicity. Therefore, the next best step is to initiate antiemetic medications and oral rehydration therapy (ORT). This will help to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent dehydration. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of worsening symptoms or deterioration, at which point the next step would be to consider additional diagnostic tests and interventions.

###Question: A 14-year-old female patient presenting a medical history indicative of seizures is admitted to the hospital, with the diagnosis of status epilepticus established. Her valproic acid level falls within the therapeutic range. Subsequently, a 24-hour video electroencephalogram (EEG) is arranged. Throughout the EEG monitoring period, the patient experiences several instances of tonic and clonic movements accompanied by moaning and crying, yet with no associated loss of bowel or bladder control. The attending neurologist reports that despite these episodes, the EEG records excessive muscle artifact but no epileptiform discharges. In this clinical scenario, what would be the most appropriate course of treatment?
###Options:
A. Adjust the dosage of valproic acid by increasing it.
B. Incorporate a scheduled benzodiazepine regimen to alleviate her muscular symptoms.
C. Request a psychiatric assessment for further evaluation.
D. Introduce carbamazepine as an adjunct to her existing seizure medication regimen.
E. Discontinue all seizure medications.


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: Incorporate a scheduled benzodiazepine regimen to alleviate her muscular symptoms.

In this scenario, the patient is experiencing tonic and clonic movements accompanied by moaning and crying, but with no associated loss of bowel or bladder control. These symptoms are suggestive of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which is often accompanied by muscle twitching and other motor activity. The absence of epileptiform discharges on the EEG, however, indicates that the patient's seizures are not due to an epileptic disorder.

The most appropriate course of treatment in this case is to incorporate a scheduled benzodiazepine regimen to alleviate the patient's muscular symptoms. The patient's tonic and clonic movements are likely a manifestation of her generalized seizure activity, which can be treated with a short-term benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or midazolam. These medications will help to abo the seizure activity and alleviate the patient's muscular symptoms.

In this scenario, the patient's seizures are not due to an epileptic disorder, as indicated by the absence of epileptiform discharges on the EEG. Therefore, discontinuing all seizure medications is not the correct course of treatment. Additionally, the patient's tonic and clonic movements are likely a manifestation of her generalized seizure activity, which can be treated with a short-term benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or midazolam. Therefore, incorporating a scheduled benzodiazepine regimen is the most appropriate course of treatment.

###Question: Which is not a side effect of furosemide (loop diuretic) in the treatment of heart failure?
###Options:
A. hypokalaemia
B. hypomagnesaemia
C. hypercalcaemia
D. hyperuricaemia
E. hyperkalaemia


### Response: The correct answer is"," option 4, hyperkalaemia. Furosemide causes hypokalaemia, not hyperkalaemia. Furosemide is a loop diuretic and is used in the treatment of congestive hea failure. It acts by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl transpoer in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This leads to increased excretion of sodium, chloride and, to a lesser extent, potassium. The most common side effects of furosemide are hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypocalcaemia. Other side effects include thiazide-like side effects such as hypercalcaemia, hyperuricaemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

###Question: A 47-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 2-month history of progressive weakness and numbness ofher right leg. She has a 3-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. She has worked as a stockperson in a storeroom for 12 years; she often moves and lifts heavy objects and sometimes crawls into tight spaces.On neurologic examination, muscle strength is 5−/5 in the hip extensor, thigh abductor, hamstring, andgastrocnemius muscles on the right and intact on the left. Muscle strength is intact in the iliopsoas, thigh adductor,quadriceps, and tibial anterior muscles bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 1  in the right ankle and 2  in the leftankle. Sensation to light touch is mildly decreased over the lateral and inferior aspects of the right foot. Sensationotherwise is intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Common peroneal neuropathy
B. Femoral neuropathy
C. L2 radiculopathy
D. L4 radiculopathy
E. Obturator neuropathy


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A Common peroneal neuropathy. This patient's symptoms of progressive weakness and numbness in the distribution of the common peroneal nerve (L4, L5, S1) are consistent with this diagnosis. The common peroneal nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg, as well as the dorsal and lateral foot. The patient's occupation as a stockperson requires frequent movement and lifting of heavy objects, which puts her at risk for developing common peroneal neuropathy. The nerve compression can result in muscle weakness and atrophy, as well as sensory loss in the distribution of the nerve.

###Question: Pulmonary edema due to “imbalance of Starling forces” includes all of the following except ?
###Options:
A. Increased pulmonary capillary pressure
B. decreased plasma oncotic pressure
C. endogenous vasoactive substances
D. increased negativity of interstitial pressure
E. N/A


### Response: The correct answer is"," option 4, increased negativity of interstitial pressure. Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the lung tissue due to an imbalance of Starling forces. The increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries is the main cause of pulmonary edema. The decreased plasma oncotic pressure also contributes to the edema. The endogenous vasoactive substances can cause the pulmonary vessels to constrict, increasing the hydrostatic pressure. The increased hydrostatic pressure causes fluid to leak from the capillaries into the interstitium. The increased interstitial fluid causes the interstitial pressure to become more negative. The Starling forces are the hydrostatic pressure, the colloid osmotic pressure, and the interstitial fluid oncotic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure is the driving force causing the fluid to move from the capillaries into the interstitium. The colloid osmotic pressure is the driving force causing the fluid to move from the interstitium into the capillaries. The interstitial fluid oncotic pressure is the driving force causing the fluid to move from the interstitium back into the capillaries.

D. ""Let's start over from scratch. We'll need to repeat complete testing.""
E. ""When nothing abnormal is found during thorough examinations and laboratory studies, there is often an  underlying psychological cause of the symptoms.""


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option B: ""I don't have much experience with chronic fatigue syndrome, but I'm committed to learning as much as I can about it."" This response demonstrates that the physician is willing to engage in a thorough discussion about chronic fatigue syndrome and is committed to learning about the condition. This response is most appropriate because it demonstrates that the physician is interested in and actively engaged in learning about chronic fatigue syndrome. The other responses demonstrate a lack of interest or commitment on the part of the physician. These responses would be unlikely to establish rapport with this patient.

###Question: A 65-year-old man with a history of kidney transplant has been on immunosuppressive therapy for the past five years. The patient had been complaining of odynophagia and weight loss, which started six months ago, and he is scheduled for an endoscopy. Endoscopy revealed two large (3-4 cm) linear ulcers noted in the distal part of the esophagus, and biopsy samples were obtained. The patient reviewed the results with the healthcare provider and was started on a 3-week course of intravenous ganciclovir, and his symptoms improved. However, the same symptoms then returned four months later. What should be the next step in the management of this patient?
###Options:
A. Intravenous ganciclovir followed by maintenance with oral valganciclovir
B. Trial of proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
C. Nissen fundoplication
D. Acyclovir
E. Broad sprectrum antibiotics


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Intravenous ganciclovir followed by maintenance with oral valganciclovir.

Option A: Intravenous ganciclovir followed by maintenance with oral valganciclovir
- This option is the correct choice as the patient is experiencing recurrent symptoms of odynophagia and weight loss, indicating a persistent infection.
- The initial course of intravenous ganciclovir was effective in treating the infection, but the symptoms have returned.
- The next step is to continue with intravenous ganciclovir therapy for a prolonged period, followed by maintenance with oral valganciclovir.
- This approach helps prevent further complications and helps prevent recurrence of the infection.
- It is important to note that the patient's immunosuppressive therapy has been ongoing for five years, which further increases the risk of viral infections such as CMV.

Option B: Trial of proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers.
- However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are suggestive of an esophageal infection rather than GERD or peptic ulcers.
- Therefore, a trial of PPI would not be effective in treating the underlying infection and would not be the appropriate next step.

Option C: Nissen fundoplication
- Nissen fundoplication is a surgical procedure used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia.
- However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with GERD or a hiatal hernia.
- The symptoms of odynophagia and weight loss are more indicative of an esophageal infection, specifically with CMV.
- Therefore, a surgical intervention such as Nissen fundoplication would not be appropriate in this case.

Option D: Broad spectrum antibiotics
- Broad spectrum antibiotics are not indicated in the management of CMV infection.
- CMV infection is typically treated with antiviral agents, such as ganciclovir, which is the correct choice in this case.
- Antibiotics would not be effective against CMV infection and would not be the appropriate next step.

B. Family illness
C. Recent travel
D. Trauma
E. Unintended weight loss


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B: family illness. The patient's symptoms of progressive weakness in the arms, moderate back pain, and sensory changes are suggestive of a neurologic disorder. The presence of a central syrinx in the cervical spinal cord on MRI is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the SMN1 gene. This gene encodes for the survival motor neuron protein. The disease is characterized by progressive degeneration and loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. The disease typically presents in infancy or early childhood and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Family illness can be a significant factor in the development of SMA. Parents of an affected child have a 4% chance of having another child with the disorder. Therefore, it is important to ask about family illness in this patient.

###Question: A 16-year-old boy presents with tea-colored urine in the morning for the past few weeks. A review of systems is positive for fatigue, mild dyspnea, and abdominal pain. His physical examination reveals an ill-looking patient with painful hepatomegaly. Laboratory testing shows elevated lactate dehydrogenase and moderate normochromic anemia with polychromasia on the blood smear. Flow cytometry reveals an absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in the red cells. What is the diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Fanconi anemia
B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
C. Acute myeloid leukemia
D. Hereditary spherocytosis
E. multiple myeloma


### Response: The correct answer is"," B: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. This young man has the clinical and laboratory features of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a disease of the red cell caused by acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene (PIGA). PNH is characterized by the triad of hemolysis, thrombosis, and pancytopenia. The hemolysis is caused by the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in the red cells, which leads to abnormalities in cell-cell interactions and increased susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis. Thrombosis is caused by the absence of CD59, a membrane protein that protects cells from complement-mediated lysis and inhibits the binding of the prothrombotic protein thrombomodulin. PNH is a clonal stem cell disorder that is associated with a high risk of acute myelogenous leukemia. The other choices are not associated with the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins.Diagnosis: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

###Question: A 3-week-old male is brought by his mother. The mother states that he vomits after every feeding. The vomitus is non-bilious and projectile in nature. Additionally, the mother states that he has started losing weight over the past few days. On examination, an olive-shaped mass is felt in the abdomen, and the patient appears extremely dehydrated. Which of the following tests should be obtained to diagnose his condition?
###Options:
A. Upper GI series with diluted barium
B. Abdominal x-ray with 20 cc air gavage
C. Ultrasound abdomen
D. Endoscopy
E. None


### Response: The correct answer is"," option B: Abdominal x-ray with 20 cc air gavage. This x-ray is the best initial test to diagnose the condition of the patient. It will show the presence of a large air-fluid level in the abdomen, indicating the presence of a large volume of gastric contents. This x-ray is also useful in evaluating the position of the mass in the abdomen. The next best test would be an upper GI series with diluted barium. This test is useful in evaluating the position of the mass and any obstruction or strictures in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Endoscopy is not indicated as an initial test because it is an invasive procedure and is not necessary for the diagnosis of the condition. Ultrasound abdomen and CT scan are not indicated as initial tests either because they are not as sensitive in diagnosing the condition as an abdominal x-ray.

###Options:
A. Chest x-ray showing hilar lymphadenopathy
B. Bence Jones proteins
C. Bone marrow biopsy showing lymphocytes
D. Increased white blood cells count and lymphocytes in the blood
E. decreased white blood cells count and lymphocytes in the blood


### Response: The correct answer is"," A. Chest x-ray showing hilar lymphadenopathy. The patient's presentation is most consistent with multiple myeloma. The laboratory findings are characteristic of multiple myeloma. The anemia is due to both marrow replacement by tumor and decreased erythropoietin production. The increased MCV and MCH are due to the presence of excessive ribosomes in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. The increased creatinine is due to renal failure from hypercalcemia. The bone pain is due to bone destruction by tumor. The hilar lymphadenopathy is a nonspecific finding. The Bence Jones proteins are paraproteins that can be found in the urine of patients with multiple myeloma. The bone marrow biopsy would show plasma cells. The white blood cell count and percentage of lymphocytes would be increased.

###Question: A 47-year-old woman presents with swelling in both knees, morning stiffness lasting more than an hour, and pain when walking. Associated symptoms include bilateral hand and wrist pain. These symptoms are present for about 3 months and are gradually progressing. The patient tried over-the-counter acetaminophen without relief from the symptoms. A review of systems is positive for fatigue and a low-grade fever. She denies rashes, oral ulcers, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. On physical examination, she demonstrates synovitis of both knees and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints bilaterally. X-rays of the hands do not show joint damage. Laboratory test results for rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-CCP, and ANA are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A. Psoriatic arthritis
B. Osteoarthritis
C. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
D. Rheumatoid arthritis
E. none


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option A: Psoriatic arthritis.

The patient's symptoms of morning stiffness, swelling, and pain in both knees and hand joints, along with fatigue and low-grade fever, are suggestive of a systemic inflammatory disease. The absence of RF, anti-CCP, and ANA makes rheumatoid arthritis less likely. The absence of joint damage on X-rays of the hands also makes osteoarthritis less likely. The absence of rash, oral ulcers, chest pain, and difficulty breathing makes systemic lupus erythematosus less likely.

Psoriatic arthritis is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy that can present with joint symptoms similar to rheumatoid arthritis. It is associated with psoriasis, which the patient has on her hands and knees. The absence of joint damage on X-rays of the hands makes psoriatic arthritis less likely.

###Question: A 55-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of a 2-month history of increasingly severe vaginal pain and itching during sexual intercourse. She avoids intercourse with her husband because of the symptoms. She has been in a monogamous relationship with her husband for the past 25 years. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows edematous and erythematous vaginal mucosa with white discharge. A photomicrograph of a vaginal smear is shown. Which of the following is the most likely causal infectious agent?
###Options:
A. Candida albicans
B. Chlamydia trachomati
C. Herpes simplex virus
D. Human papillomavirus
E. Trichomonas vaginalis


### Response: The correct answer is"," D: Human papillomavirus. The patient's symptoms of vaginal pain and itching, along with the presence of edematous and erythematous vaginal mucosa with white discharge, are suggestive of a viral infection. The photomicrograph of the vaginal smear shows koilocytosis, which is a characteristic finding of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is the most likely causal infectious agent in this case.

HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital warts. It is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, affecting 14 million people. The incidence of HPV infection increases with age, and 50% of women will be infected at some point in their lives. HPV is a DNA virus that infects the squamous epithelium of the skin and mucous membranes. It is most commonly transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact during sexual activity. HPV can also be spread through the sharing of contaminated personal care items, such as towels and sex toys. HPV infection is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause genital warts in some individuals. These warts can cause pain, itching, and discomfort, which can interfere with sexual intercourse.

The treatment of HPV infection is dependent on the severity of symptoms. For mild symptoms, such as genital warts, over-the-counter medications can be used. For more severe symptoms, such as vaginal pain and itching, or in immunocompromised individuals, prescription medications can be used. In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe enough that she has avoided intercourse with her husband. Therefore, treatment with a prescription medication is indicated. The most common prescription medications used to treat HPV infection are the antiviral medications called topical podophyllin and the antiparasitic medication called podophyllotoxin.

###Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of severe, progressive shortnessof breath associated with exacerbation of his chronic cough. He has a 6-week history of pneumonia, which hasresponded slowly to treatment. Prior to the onset of his current symptoms, he had minimally productive cough and mildshortness of breath after walking one or two blocks. He also has had a low-grade fever for 6 days. He has no otherhistory of serious illness. Current medications are erythromycin and an over-the-counter cough suppressant. He hassmoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. On arrival, he appears ill. He is diaphoretic and in severe respiratorydistress. Temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 36/min and shallow, and blood pressure is70/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 83%. Examination shows perioral cyanosis.There is no jugular venous distention. Diffuse crackles and wheezes are heard throughout the lungs. Heart sounds arenormal. While a blood sample is being taken, the patient's blood pressure decreases, and he stops breathing. He isintubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Laboratory studies show:Hematocrit 42%Leukocyte count 16,000/mm3Segmented neutrophils 85%Lymphocytes 15% Platelet count 200,000/mm3Arterial blood gas analysis on an FIO2 of 1.0 shows:pH 7.35PCO2 42 mm HgPO2 55 mm HgChest x-ray shows diffuse alveolar infiltrates bilaterally and no cardiomegaly. Following intravenous administration of fluids, his blood pressure increases to 118/80 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
###Options:
A. Continuation of mechanical ventilation at the current setting
B. Administration of cyclophosphamide
C. Administration of dexamethasone
D. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
E. Application of positive end-expiratory pressure


### Response: The correct answer is"," Option D: Application of positive end-expiratory pressure.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by progressive dyspnea, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the setting of a known or suspected insult. The patient's history of pneumonia and recent exacerbation are consistent with ARDS. The low oxygen saturation and low blood pressure are also consistent with ARDS. The patient's history of smoking and chronic cough are risk factors for the development of ARDS.

The next step in management is to apply positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). PEEP is a form of non-invasive mechanical ventilation that works by applying a positive pressure during expiration, which helps to keep the alveoli open and prevents further damage. PEEP is commonly used in the management of ARDS and is a key component of the ARDSnet protocol. It is important to note that the patient's oxygen saturation is improving while on mechanical ventilation, which is a good sign.

The next step in management would be to determine the etiology of the patient's ARDS. In this case, the patient's history of smoking and chronic cough suggest a possible etiology of smoking-related lung disease. Smoking-related lung disease is a common cause of ARDS, and it is important to determine the cause in order to guide further management. Other potential causes of ARDS include sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, and trauma.

The next step in management would be to determine the severity of the patient's ARDS. The patient's oxygen saturation is improving while on mechanical ventilation, which is a good sign. However, the patient's low blood pressure and low cardiac output suggest that his ARDS is severe. The Berlin definition of ARDS requires that the patient have bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300 mm Hg, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of more than 5 cm H2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is above 90% on the current setting of PEEP 8 cm H2O, which is not sufficient to meet the definition of ARDS. Therefore, the patient's ARDS is not severe enough to require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

The patient's low blood pressure and low cardiac output suggest that his ARDS is severe. The next step in management would be to determine the severity of the patient's ARDS. The Berlin definition of ARDS requires that the patient have bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300 mm Hg, and a PEEP of more than 5 cm H2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is above 90% on the current setting of PEEP 8 cm H2O, which is not sufficient to meet the definition of ARDS.
