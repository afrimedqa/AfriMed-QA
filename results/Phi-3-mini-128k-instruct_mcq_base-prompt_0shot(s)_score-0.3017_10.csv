Question: Which of the following statements accurately reflects the management approach for a 62-year-old obese woman with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who experiences vaginal bleeding for the first time since her menopause 11 years ago?
A.  She probably has fibroids
B.  The woman's symptoms are most likely due to the presence of an arteriovenous malformation in the uterine wall.
C.  She should undergo evaluation with a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound, and referral for endometrial sampling is necessary.
D.  She has engaged in energetic sexual intercourse
","C. She should undergo evaluation with a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound, and referral for endometrial sampling is necessary.

Rationale: Postmenopausal bleeding is a symptom that requires thorough evaluation to rule out serious conditions such as endometrial cancer. The patient's age, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes all increase her risk for endometrial cancer. Therefore, a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound are necessary to assess the uterus and endometrium. Endometrial sampling is also necessary to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

B.  Cross-linking acetylcholine receptors, thereby increasing their rate of internalization
C.  Binding of complement resulting in destruction of the muscle end plate
D.  All of the above
E.  None of the above
","D

Rationale: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. These antibodies can interfere with neuromuscular transmission in multiple ways. They can bind directly to the acetylcholine receptors, blocking the binding of acetylcholine (option A), which is crucial for muscle contraction. They can also cross-link the receptors, leading to their internalization and degradation, thus reducing the number of functional receptors available for acetylcholine binding (option B). Additionally, the binding of these antibodies can activate the complement system, leading to the destruction of the muscle end plate (option C). Therefore, all of the mechanisms listed are possible ways in which acetylcholine receptor antibodies can interfere with neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia gravis.",D,True,0.12499999820000002,0.017543858496460524,0.07499999820000004,0.813831,0.8961883,0.8530264
