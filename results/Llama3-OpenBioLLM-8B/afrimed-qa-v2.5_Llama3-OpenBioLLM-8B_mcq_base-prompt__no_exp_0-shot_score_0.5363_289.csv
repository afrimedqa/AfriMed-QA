He has AIDS and is not under any care at this time. His physical examination is most notable for small, shoddy lymphadenopathy in the cervical region. A head CT shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe, with edema but no mass effect. A lumbar puncture shows no white or red blood cells, and the Gram stain is negative. His serum Toxoplasma IgG is positive. Which of the following is the best course of action for this patient at this time?
###Options:
A.  Biopsy of the central nervous system (CNS) lesion
B.  Dexamethasone
C.  Search for systemic malignancy
D.  Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis
E.  Whole-brain radiation therapy

###Answer: The correct letter option is "," D. Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis.  Explanation: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of CNS toxoplasmosis, given his AIDS status, positive serum Toxoplasma IgG, and the imaging findings of a ring-enhancing lesion in the brain with edema but no mass effect. CNS toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients and typically does not respond to antibiotics alone. However, it is highly responsive to a combination of antibiotics",D,True
