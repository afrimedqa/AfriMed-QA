These bands and adhesions can form due to a history of abdominal surgery, peritonitis, or abdominal infections, which are relatively common in the Ghanaian population. This can lead to the obstruction of the small bowel. While other causes listed are potential causes of small bowel obstruction, band and adhesions are the most common in this particular region.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.76977146,0.86627567,0.8151774

###Answer:","The correct option is C. Bladder cancer.

###Rationale:
Schistosomiasis is caused by parasitic worms and can lead to various clinical manifestations. 'Ground' itch, hepatomegaly, Katayama fever, and spinal cord compression are all clinical manifestations associated with schistosomiasis. However, while schistosomiasis can increase the risk of bladder cancer due to chronic inflammation and irritation, bladder cancer itself is not a direct clinical manifestation of schistosomiasis.

Rationale:
- PCP is common in HIV-infected individuals and presents with fever, dyspnea, and a dry cough.
- The chest radiograph findings of bilateral peri-hilar interstitial infiltrates in a butterfly pattern are typical of PCP.
- In HIV-positive patients, oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) is the first-line therapy for PCP.
- Dapsone is part of the first-line therapy regimen for PCP in combination with trimethoprim.
- Tuberculous lymphadenitis does not explain the chest radiograph findings in this case.

###Answer:","A. Low gastric pH protects against infection

###Rationale:
Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which enters the body through contaminated food or water. Low gastric pH is a protective factor against cholera, as it helps in killing ingested bacteria before they can cause an infection.

###Options:
A.  Perforation occurring in the first week of typhoid fever has a better prognosis as the patient’s nutritional and immunological status is better
B.  Treatment involves vigorous resuscitation with intravenous  fluids and antibiotics in an intensive care unit
C.  Chloramphenicol is the drug of choice
D.  Several surgical options can be carried out, depending on the condition of the patient, the site and number of perforations and the amount of peritoneal soiling
E.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue are often kept open for delayed closure, as wound infection inevitably happens, leading to wound dehiscence

###Answer:","C. Chloramphenicol is the drug of choice

###Rationale:
Chloramphenicol was previously the drug of choice for typhoid fever, including in cases of typhoid perforation. However, due to the increasing incidence of drug-resistant strains, including chloramphenicol-resistant strains, it is no longer the preferred drug. Current guidelines recommend the use of third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones for the treatment of typhoid fever and its complications, including perforation.

A.  Request Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate.
B.  Request a Chest X-ray.
C.  Commence anti-tuberculous drugs.
D.  Request BCG vaccine administration.

###Answer:","B. Request a Chest X-ray.

###Rationale:
A tuberculin test result of 10mm in a 10-year-old female with a chronic cough indicates a possible exposure or infection with tuberculosis. The next important step would be to request a chest X-ray to evaluate for signs of active pulmonary tuberculosis. A chest X-ray can help to identify any abnormalities in the lungs and confirm the presence of active disease. Based on the findings from the chest X-ray, further diagnostic tests and treatment decisions can be made. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate may be considered to support the diagnosis, but a chest X-ray is the most appropriate initial investigation. Commencing anti-tuberculous drugs or BCG vaccine administration should be guided by the chest X-ray findings and overall clinical assessment.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7580892,0.860083,0.8058717

The likely diagnosis is acute blepharitis.

Ulcerations of eyelid margins are indicative of an infectious cause of the symptoms. The likely causes are Staphylococcus and viral causes. Acute blepharitis should always be treated with topical antibiotics.

All types of blepharitis should be treated with eyelid hygiene and avoidance of potential triggers.

###Question: Aisha, a 17-year-old girl presents with a 3-day history of bilateral itching, burning, crusting, and matting of her eyelids, which worsens when she awakens in the morning. The patient has no prior history of a similar event. On physical exam, there is crusting of the eyelashes at the bases, erythema of the eyelids, clear conjunctiva, and cornea. There are small ulcers on the eyelid margins. The meibomian glands appear normal. Which of the following is not first-line treatment?
###Options:
A.  Warm compresses and lid margin scrubs with a cotton swab dipped in diluted baby shampoo
B.  Avoidance of eye makeup
C.  Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment
D.  Oral doxycycline
E.  None

###Answer:","The correct option is D. Oral doxycycline

###Rationale:
The condition described in the question is consistent with blepharitis, which is commonly treated initially with warm compresses and lid margin scrubs with a cotton swab dipped in diluted baby shampoo (Option A). Avoidance of eye makeup (Option B) is also a part of the first-line management for blepharitis. Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment (Option C) can be used to manage the acute phase of blepharitis. However, oral doxycycline (Option D) is not typically considered first-line treatment for blepharitis, as it is usually reserved for cases of severe or refractory blepharitis. Therefore, it is not the first-line treatment in this case. Hence, the correct answer is D. Oral doxycycline.",D,True,0.27642275954524426,0.05747125963205217,0.24390243434199224,0.8418955,0.8649584,0.8532712
