A.  V/Q Scan.
B.  CXR.
C.  D-Dimer..
D.  ECG.
E.  CTPA.

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. D-Dimer.

Rationale:
In the investigation of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy, the following investigations are appropriate:

A. V/Q Scan (Ventilation/Perfusion Scan): This is a nuclear medicine imaging test that can help diagnose PE by assessing the ventilation and perfusion of the lungs. It is considered a safe option in pregnancy.

B. CXR (Chest X-Ray): A chest X-ray can help rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as pneumonia or heart failure.

D. ECG (Electrocardiogram): An ECG can help identify any abnormalities in the heart's electrical activity that may be associated with PE.

E. CTPA (Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography): This is the gold standard imaging test for diagnosing PE, as it can directly visualize the pulmonary arteries and detect the presence of blood clots.

C. D-Dimer is not an appropriate investigation in this case. D-Dimer is a blood test that measures the presence of fibrin degradation products, which can be elevated in various conditions, including PE. However, D-Dimer levels are often elevated in normal pregnancy, making it a less reliable test for diagnosing PE in pregnant women.

###Answer:","A. True

Rationale:
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection seen in people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa. PCP is caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously known as Pneumocystis carinii) and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with weakened immune systems, particularly those with advanced HIV/AIDS.

In Africa, where the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been particularly severe, PCP is one of the most common opportunistic infections affecting people living with HIV/AIDS. The high prevalence of PCP in this region is due to the high rates of HIV/AIDS, limited access to antiretroviral therapy, and the lack of effective prophylaxis and treatment for PCP.

E.  None of the above

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Fibromedial hypertrophy.

Rationale:
Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common cause of secondary hypertension in children, and the most common cause of RAS in children in Kenya is fibromedial hypertrophy.

Fibromedial hypertrophy is a condition characterized by the thickening of the media layer of the renal artery wall, leading to narrowing of the artery and reduced blood flow to the kidney. This is the most common cause of RAS in children, particularly in developing countries like Kenya, where it is often associated with malnutrition and chronic infections.

The other options are less likely to be the most common cause of RAS in children in Kenya:
A. Takayasu Aortoarteritis is a rare, chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the aorta and its major branches, and is more common in adults.

###Options:
A.  Humans
B.  Fruit bats
C.  Primates
D.  pigs
E.  Rats

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Fruit bats.

Rationale:
Lassa and Ebola viruses are both zoonotic viruses, meaning they originate from animal reservoirs and can be transmitted to humans. The primary reservoir hosts for both Lassa and Ebola viruses are fruit bats.

Lassa virus is primarily found in West Africa and is carried by the Mastomys rodent, also known as the ""multimammate rat."" However, the natural reservoir for the Lassa virus is the fruit bat species Hipposideros and Epomops.

Ebola virus is also found in West and Central Africa, and the natural reservoir for the virus is believed to be certain species of fruit bats, such as the hammer-headed bat, the little collared fruit bat, and the Franquet's epauletted fruit bat.

Humans, primates, and pigs are not the natural reservoirs for these viruses, but they can become infected through contact with the natural reservoir hosts or their bodily fluids. Rats can also become infected with Lassa virus, but they are not the primary reservoir.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Fruit bats, as they are the natural reservoir hosts for both Lassa and Ebola viruses.",B,True,0.2166666626055556,0.02150537284772863,0.18333332927222232,0.81216854,0.8541837,0.83264637

###Options:
A.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
B.  Follicular lymphoma
C.  Mantle cell lymphoma
D.  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
E.  Burkitt lymphoma

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

Rationale:
The key features in this case are:
- Painless, firm, enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical and axillary regions
- Excisional lymph node biopsy showing a diffuse proliferation of large, pleomorphic lymphoid cells
- Expression of CD15 and CD30 on the lymphoid cells

These findings are most consistent with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of large, pleomorphic lymphoid cells that express CD30 and often CD15.

In the operative management of major omphalocele in Nigeria, the use of a prosthetic silo is the preferred approach. A prosthetic silo, also known as a staged silo or preformed silo, is a commonly used technique for the management of large omphaloceles.

The key reasons why a prosthetic silo is the preferred option are:

1. Gradual reduction of the omphalocele contents: The prosthetic silo allows for a gradual, controlled reduction of the omphalocele contents, which helps to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory compromise that can occur with immediate closure.

2. Availability and accessibility: Prosthetic silo materials, such as silicone or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), are more readily available and accessible in Nigeria compared to other options like Teflon/Gore-Tex mesh, prolene mesh, or silastic sheets.

3. Familiarity and experience: The use of prosthetic silos has become a well-established and widely adopted technique for omphalocele management in Nigeria, with surgeons having significant experience and expertise in this approach.

In contrast, the other options mentioned (Teflon/Gore-Tex mesh, prolene mesh, silastic sheet, and normal saline bag) are less commonly used or may not be as readily available in the Nigerian healthcare setting.",A,False,0.26519336556271184,0.06896551279693515,0.23204419429199358,0.8120753,0.85722154,0.8340379

###Question: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the recto-sigmoid.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","A. True

Rationale:
The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the recto-sigmoid region. This is supported by several studies conducted in Nigeria, which have consistently shown that the recto-sigmoid region is the most common location for colorectal cancer in the Nigerian population.

A study published in the Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice in 2016 analyzed the clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer in a Nigerian tertiary hospital. The study found that the recto-sigmoid region was the most common site of colorectal cancer, accounting for 58.8% of the cases.

Another study published in the Annals of African Medicine in 2012 also reported that the recto-sigmoid region was the most common site of colorectal cancer in a Nigerian population, with 54.3% of the cases occurring in this location.

The higher prevalence of colorectal cancer in the recto-sigmoid region in Nigeria is likely due to a combination of factors, including dietary habits, lifestyle factors, and genetic predisposition. The recto-sigmoid region is particularly susceptible to the development of colorectal cancer due to its anatomical and physiological characteristics.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. True, as the commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the recto-sigmoid region, as supported by multiple studies conducted in the country.",A,True,0.20952380764807257,0.1315789461391967,0.20952380764807257,0.8315748,0.9078876,0.86805725

C.  Wilson's disease
D.  Alcohol-induced liver injury
E.  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

Rationale:
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common cause of acute liver failure in Africa. HBV is highly endemic in many African countries, with a prevalence of chronic HBV infection ranging from 6% to 20% in the general population.

Acute HBV infection can lead to fulminant hepatic failure, which is a severe and life-threatening form of liver failure. This is particularly common in areas with high HBV endemicity, where exposure to the virus often occurs at a young age.

The other options are less common causes of acute liver failure in Africa:
A. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is less prevalent as a cause of acute liver failure in Africa compared to HBV.
C. Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to acute liver failure, but it is not a common cause in Africa.
D. Alcohol-induced liver injury is a significant cause of chronic liver disease in Africa, but it is less common as a cause of acute liver failure.

###Question: The most common cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria is intestinal obstruction.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","B. False

Rationale:
The most common cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria is not intestinal obstruction. According to the available evidence, the most common cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria is acute appendicitis.

Studies conducted in Nigeria have consistently shown that acute appendicitis is the leading cause of acute abdomen, accounting for a significant proportion of cases. This is likely due to the high prevalence of appendicitis in the Nigerian population, which can be attributed to factors such as dietary habits, genetic predisposition, and environmental influences.

In contrast, while intestinal obstruction is a common cause of acute abdomen, it is not the most prevalent one in the Nigerian context. Intestinal obstruction can have various etiologies, including adhesions, hernias, tumors, and volvulus, but it does not surpass acute appendicitis as the primary cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria.

###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Septic arthritis
D.  Gout
E.  Pseudogout

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Septic arthritis.

Rationale:
The key features in this case are the presence of a painful, swollen, and warm knee joint, along with the synovial fluid analysis showing an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance. These findings are most consistent with septic arthritis, which is an infection within the joint space.

Osteoarthritis (A) typically presents with joint pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, but the joint is usually not as warm or swollen as in this case. Additionally, the synovial fluid analysis would not show a predominance of neutrophils.

Rheumatoid arthritis (B) can also cause joint swelling and pain, but the synovial fluid analysis would typically show a predominance of mononuclear cells, not neutrophils.

Gout (D) and pseudogout (E) can both cause acute joint inflammation, but the synovial fluid analysis would typically show the presence of monosodium urate or calcium pyrophosphate crystals, respectively, rather than a predominance of neutrophils.

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. folic acid supplementation.

Rationale:
Sickle cell anemia is a chronic, inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that can cause red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. In the steady state, the management of sickle cell anemia in Nigeria includes the following:

A. Steady state hemoglobin: This is not a valid management option in the steady state, as it is a laboratory parameter that needs to be monitored, not a management intervention.

B. Blood transfusion: Blood transfusion is not a routine management option in the steady state. It may be used during acute complications or in certain situations, but it is not a valid management in the steady state.

C. Intravenous fluids: Intravenous fluids are not a routine management option in the steady state. They may be used during acute complications, but they are not a valid management in the steady state.

D. Folic acid supplementation: Folic acid supplementation is a valid management option in the steady state of sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell patients have an increased demand for folic acid due to the increased red blood cell turnover, and folic acid supplementation helps maintain adequate levels and prevent anemia.

E. Malaria prophylaxis: Malaria prophylaxis is a valid management option in the steady state of sickle cell anemia in Nigeria, as malaria can trigger acute sickle cell crises and worsen the condition.

###Question: A 50-year-old African patient with a history of asthma presents with wheezing, dyspnea, and chest tightness triggered by exposure to pollen. Pulmonary function tests reveal reversible airflow obstruction. Which of the following medications is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's acute exacerbation?
###Options:
A.  Inhaled corticosteroids
B.  Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs)
C.  Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs)
D.  Leukotriene receptor antagonists
E.  Theophylline

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs).

Rationale:
In the case of an acute asthma exacerbation, the most appropriate initial treatment is the use of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs), such as albuterol or salbutamol. These medications act quickly to relax and dilate the airways, providing rapid relief of symptoms like wheezing, dyspnea, and chest tightness.

Inhaled corticosteroids (option A) are not the appropriate initial treatment for an acute exacerbation. They are more effective for long-term control and prevention of asthma symptoms, but they do not provide immediate relief during an acute episode.

Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs, option B) are not recommended as monotherapy for acute exacerbations. They have a slower onset of action and are primarily used for long-term asthma control in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (option D) and theophylline (option E) are not the most appropriate initial treatments for an acute asthma exacerbation. These medications have a slower onset of action and are not as effective as SABAs for immediate symptom relief.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's acute asthma exacerbation is the use of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs), such as albuterol or salbutamol.",C,True,0.24137930784334125,0.04907975283074266,0.2241379285329965,0.8272048,0.88870764,0.856854

###Answer:","B. False

Rationale:
The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the rectum, not the ascending colon. Several studies have shown that the rectum is the most common site of colorectal cancer in the Nigerian population.

In a study conducted in Nigeria, it was found that the rectum was the most common site of colorectal cancer, accounting for about 50% of all cases. This is consistent with the epidemiological pattern observed in other parts of Africa, where the rectum is the predominant site of colorectal cancer.

The ascending colon is not the most common site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria. The distribution of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is similar to that observed in other parts of the world, with the rectum being the most common site, followed by the sigmoid colon and the descending colon.

B. Oral antibiotics alone may not be enough to effectively manage a severe, deep-seated infection without proper wound management.
C. Surgical debridement and irrigation are the most appropriate initial steps to address a large, infected wound. This helps remove necrotic tissue, foreign material, and reduce the bacterial load, which is crucial for promoting wound healing.
D. Limb amputation should be the last resort and is not the most appropriate initial management for this case, as the wound may be salvageable with proper wound care.
E. Conservative management with regular wound cleaning may not be sufficient for a large, infected wound, as it requires more active intervention to control the infection and promote healing.

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction.

Rationale:
The patient's presentation of chronic knee pain, swelling, instability, and a positive Lachman test, along with imaging findings of an ACL tear, is indicative of an ACL injury. The most appropriate treatment option in this case is arthroscopic ACL reconstruction.

A. Conservative management with physical therapy may be appropriate for partial ACL tears or in patients who are less physically active. However, for a complete ACL tear in a physically active patient, conservative management alone is unlikely to provide adequate stability and function.

B. Open ACL repair is generally not the preferred treatment approach, as arthroscopic ACL reconstruction has become the standard of care for complete ACL tears. Open repair is less commonly performed and has a higher risk of complications.

C. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient. It involves using a graft (either from the patient's own tissue or a donor) to reconstruct the torn ACL, which can restore knee stability and function.

D. Knee brace immobilization is not recommended as the primary treatment for a complete ACL tear, as it does not address the underlying ligament injury and may lead to further joint stiffness and muscle atrophy.

###Options:
A.  Bone densitometry
B.  Ultrasound
C.  MRI
D.  Nuclear medicine
E.  PET

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Ultrasound.

Rationale:
Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging modality for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver cirrhosis and related complications in Africa. Ultrasound is a widely available, cost-effective, and non-invasive imaging technique that can provide valuable information about the liver's structure, texture, and vascular changes associated with cirrhosis.

Ultrasound can detect the characteristic features of liver cirrhosis, such as an irregular liver surface, coarse liver parenchyma, and the presence of regenerative nodules. It can also be used to assess the severity of cirrhosis by evaluating the degree of liver enlargement, the presence of portal hypertension (e.g., splenomegaly, ascites), and the development of complications like hepatocellular carcinoma.

In contrast, the other imaging modalities mentioned in the options are less commonly used for the primary diagnosis and monitoring of liver cirrhosis in Africa:

A. Bone densitometry is used to assess bone mineral density, which is not the primary focus for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver cirrhosis.
C. MRI can provide more detailed information about the liver, but it is generally less accessible and more expensive than ultrasound in many African settings.
D. Nuclear medicine techniques, such as scintigraphy, are not routinely used for the evaluation of liver cirrhosis.
E. PET (Positron Emission Tomography) is primarily used for the detection of cancer and is not a first-line imaging modality for liver cirrhosis.

Rheumatic fever is a common consequence of untreated or inadequately treated streptococcal throat infections, which are prevalent in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa due to limited access to healthcare and antibiotic treatment.

The other options are less common causes of heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa:
A. Congenital heart disease is less prevalent as a cause of heart failure in this region.
B. Cardiomyopathy can occur, but it is not the most common cause.
C. Coronary artery disease is less common in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions.

###Question: A 60-year-old African patient presents with a history of progressive hip pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. Imaging reveals joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. Laboratory investigations show elevated levels of serum uric acid. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?
###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Avascular necrosis
D.  Septic arthritis
E.  Gout

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. Gout.

Rationale:
The key features in this case presentation are the progressive hip pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, along with the imaging findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, and the elevated serum uric acid levels. These findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of gout.

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints, leading to joint inflammation and pain. The involvement of the hip joint, the radiographic findings, and the elevated uric acid levels strongly point towards a diagnosis of gout in this patient.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
A. Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees, but the radiographic findings of subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation are more characteristic of gout.
B. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that typically affects multiple joints symmetrically, and the radiographic findings would be different from those seen in this case.
C. Avascular necrosis of the hip joint can present with similar symptoms, but the radiographic findings would be more specific, such as subchondral collapse and cystic changes.
D. Septic arthritis is an acute condition characterized by joint pain, swelling, and fever, which is not the presentation in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this 60-year-old African patient with the given clinical and radiographic findings is gout.",E,True,0.23129251465593043,0.10762331667960347,0.21768707247905966,0.8083189,0.9195554,0.8603566

###Question: What is a cultural belief in some African communities that may hinder the early detection and treatment of testicular cancer, and how can healthcare providers address this challenge?
###Options:
A.  Belief in traditional healers for the treatment of testicular masses, delaying access to standard medical care
B.  Stigma surrounding genital examinations, resulting in avoidance of healthcare facilities for screening
C.  Association of testicular lumps with infertility, leading to delayed presentation for medical evaluation
D.  Perception of testicular cancer as a punishment for immoral behavior, leading to social isolation and discrimination
E.  Fear of emasculation associated with orchidectomy, causing reluctance to undergo surgical intervention

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Stigma surrounding genital examinations, resulting in avoidance of healthcare facilities for screening.

Rationale:
In some African communities, there may be a cultural belief that genital examinations, including those for testicular cancer screening, are taboo or shameful. This stigma can lead to individuals avoiding healthcare facilities and delaying or refusing to undergo necessary examinations. As a result, testicular cancer may not be detected early, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

To address this challenge, healthcare providers can take the following steps:

1. Culturally sensitive education: Educate the community about the importance of early detection and the benefits of regular testicular self-examinations and medical checkups. This can help reduce the stigma and encourage individuals to seek healthcare services.

2. Involving community leaders: Collaborate with respected community leaders, such as religious figures or elders, to promote the importance of testicular cancer screening and destigmatize genital examinations. Their endorsement can have a significant impact on the community's perceptions and behaviors.

3. Providing privacy and comfort: Ensure that healthcare facilities offer private and comfortable environments for genital examinations, with healthcare providers who are trained to be sensitive and respectful during the process.

4. Addressing misconceptions: Dispel any misconceptions or cultural beliefs that may hinder early detection and treatment, such as the association of testicular lumps with infertility or the perception of testicular cancer as a punishment.

5. Culturally appropriate communication: Use culturally appropriate language and communication methods to educate the community about testicular cancer, its symptoms, and the importance of seeking medical attention.

By addressing the cultural beliefs and stigma surrounding genital examinations, healthcare providers can encourage early detection and timely treatment of testicular cancer, ultimately improving health outcomes in the affected communities.",B,False,0.2926829235712076,0.1212121186881158,0.28292682601023206,0.8393689,0.9142163,0.87519526

D.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
E.  Diabetes

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Viral hepatitis B.

Rationale:
In Africa, the most common cause of chronic liver disease is viral hepatitis B. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in many African countries, with high rates of chronic HBV infection. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Africa is estimated to be around 8-20%, which is significantly higher than the global average of 3.5%.

Viral hepatitis B is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Africa. The high prevalence of HBV infection is primarily due to perinatal and early childhood transmission, as well as the lack of widespread hepatitis B vaccination programs in many African countries.

The other options are less common causes of chronic liver disease in Africa:
A. Alcoholic liver disease is less prevalent in Africa compared to other regions due to cultural and socioeconomic factors.
C. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging problem in Africa, but it is not the most common cause of chronic liver disease.
D. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complication of chronic liver disease, often caused by viral hepatitis, and is not a primary cause of chronic liver disease.

Rationale:
Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in Africa, accounting for approximately 22% of all cancer cases in the region.

The reasons for the high prevalence of cervical cancer in Africa include:
1. Limited access to cervical cancer screening and early detection programs, leading to late-stage diagnosis.
2. High prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is the primary cause of cervical cancer.
3. Lack of widespread HPV vaccination programs.

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Pellagra.

Rationale:
Pellagra is a nutritional deficiency disorder characterized by symmetric pigmented patches on the skin, often referred to as the ""three Ds"": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. It is commonly associated with a deficiency in niacin (vitamin B3) or tryptophan, which is a precursor to niacin.

Pellagra is a common nutritional deficiency disorder in African populations, particularly in areas where the diet is heavily dependent on maize (corn) as a staple food. Maize is low in niacin, and the niacin in maize is also not readily bioavailable, leading to a higher risk of pellagra in populations that rely on maize as a primary food source.

B.  Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury
C.  Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
D.  Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury
E.  Meniscus tear

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.

Rationale:
The key findings in this case are acute knee pain and swelling following a twisting injury, along with a positive anterior drawer test. The anterior drawer test is a clinical examination maneuver used to assess the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

A positive anterior drawer test, where the tibia can be displaced anteriorly relative to the femur, is a strong indicator of an ACL injury. The ACL is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee, especially in sports that involve sudden changes in direction, deceleration, and landing from a jump.

The other options are less likely in this scenario:
A. Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury - MCL injuries typically present with medial knee pain and instability, without a positive anterior drawer test.
B. Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury - LCL injuries are less common and would not typically present with a positive anterior drawer test.
D. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury - PCL injuries present with posterior knee pain and a positive posterior drawer test, not an anterior drawer test.
E. Meniscus tear - Meniscus tears can cause knee pain and swelling, but the positive anterior drawer test is more indicative of an ACL injury.

Rationale:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a common infectious disease in many parts of the world, including Africa. The typical presentation of TB in African adults often includes the following symptoms:

A. Pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray: TB primarily affects the lungs, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray are a common radiographic finding.

B. Hemoptysis (coughing up blood): Hemoptysis can occur due to the destruction of lung tissue by the TB infection.

C. Night sweats: Profuse night sweats are a common symptom of active TB infection.

D. Weight loss: TB can cause significant weight loss due to the metabolic demands of the infection and decreased appetite.

E. All of the above: The combination of pulmonary infiltrates, hemoptysis, night sweats, and weight loss is a common presentation of TB in African adults.

###Options:
A.  alcohol
B.  aqueous mecurochrome
C.  Dermazine cream+sufratulle
D.  Honey
E.  vaseline impregnated with penicillin

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Honey.

Rationale:
Omphalocele is a congenital abdominal wall defect where the intestines and other abdominal organs protrude through the navel. In the case of a major omphalocele, the defect is large, and the management can be either surgical or non-operative.

In Nigeria, where resources may be limited, non-operative management using honey has been reported as an effective and safe approach for managing major omphaloceles.

Honey has several properties that make it suitable for the non-operative management of omphaloceles:
1. Antimicrobial properties: Honey has natural antibacterial and antifungal properties, which help prevent infection of the exposed organs.
2. Wound healing properties: Honey promotes the healing of the omphalocele sac and the surrounding skin.
3. Ease of application: Honey can be easily applied to the omphalocele sac, providing a protective and moist environment for the exposed organs.

The other options are not recommended for the non-operative management of major omphaloceles:
A. Alcohol: Alcohol is not suitable for the management of omphaloceles as it can be irritating to the exposed organs and delay wound healing.
B. Aqueous mercurochrome: Mercurochrome is a topical antiseptic that is no longer recommended for use due to concerns about mercury toxicity.
C. Dermazine cream + Sufratulle: This combination is not a standard treatment for omphaloceles and may not provide the necessary protection and wound healing properties.
E. Vaseline impregnated with penicillin: Vaseline alone does not have the same wound healing and antimicrobial properties as honey, and the addition of penicillin may not be necessary for the non-operative management of omphaloceles.",D,False,0.16766466786761808,0.015999998010880246,0.15568861996342648,0.8172574,0.8673733,0.84156996

###Options:
A.  Vitamin A
B.  Thiamine
C.  Pyridoxine
D.  Biotin
E.  Niacin

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Pyridoxine.

Rationale:
The patient's presentation with cough, fever, weight loss, and positive PPD skin test along with the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum gram staining is highly suggestive of tuberculosis (TB). The patient has been started on appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy.

The new symptoms of tingling sensation in the hands and feet, in the absence of any changes in diet or lifestyle, are likely due to a side effect of the anti-tuberculosis medication, specifically isoniazid (INH). Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy, which is a common adverse effect of this drug.

The best therapy for this patient's new symptoms is pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Pyridoxine supplementation is recommended for patients on isoniazid therapy to prevent and treat peripheral neuropathy. Pyridoxine helps to prevent the depletion of vitamin B6 caused by isoniazid, which can lead to the development of peripheral neuropathy.

Rationale:
Neisseria meningitidis, also known as the meningococcus, is a common etiological agent of meningitis in the African meningitis belt countries. The meningitis belt is a region in sub-Saharan Africa that stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east and is characterized by high incidence of meningococcal meningitis epidemics.

The other options are not the most common causes of meningitis in the African meningitis belt:

###Question: Kaposi's sarcoma is primarily caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and is more prevalent in Africa compared to other regions.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","A. True

Rationale:
Kaposi's sarcoma is primarily caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). HHV-8 is the necessary and sufficient causative agent for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma.

Kaposi's sarcoma is more prevalent in certain regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, compared to other parts of the world. This is due to the higher prevalence of HHV-8 infection in these regions. In Africa, the seroprevalence of HHV-8 can reach up to 50-80% in the general population, whereas in other parts of the world, the seroprevalence is generally lower, around 5-20%.

The higher prevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma in Africa is attributed to various factors, including the higher rate of HHV-8 transmission, the presence of co-infections (such as HIV), and socioeconomic and environmental factors that may contribute to the increased risk of HHV-8 infection and Kaposi's sarcoma development.",A,True,0.19999999704800003,0.057142854902040914,0.15999999704800005,0.82554716,0.88531893,0.8543889

###Options:
A.  Aortic regurgitation
B.  Mitral regurgitation
C.  Ventricular septal defect
D.  Atrial fibrillation
E.  Aortic dissection

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Aortic regurgitation.

Rationale:
Infective endocarditis is a serious condition that can lead to various complications, including valvular dysfunction. One of the common complications of infective endocarditis is aortic regurgitation, which occurs when the aortic valve becomes damaged or destroyed by the infection, leading to backward flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle.

Aortic regurgitation can be a life-threatening complication that may require surgical intervention, such as aortic valve replacement, to prevent further damage to the heart and improve the patient's prognosis.

The other options are not the most common complications of infective endocarditis that would require surgical intervention:
- Mitral regurgitation is another possible complication, but it is less common than aortic regurgitation.
- Ventricular septal defect is not a typical complication of infective endocarditis.
- Atrial fibrillation can occur as a result of the infection, but it does not necessarily require surgical intervention.
- Aortic dissection is a different condition that is not directly related to infective endocarditis.

###Options:
A.  Ovarian torsion
B.  Uterine rupture
C.  Placenta previa
D.  Ectopic pregnancy
E.  Preeclampsia

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Uterine rupture.

Rationale:
Uterine rupture is a common cause of obstetric emergencies in Africa. Uterine rupture is a serious complication that can occur during pregnancy or labor, where the uterine wall tears, leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding and complications for both the mother and the fetus.

In the context of Africa, several factors contribute to the higher incidence of uterine rupture, including:
- Lack of access to quality prenatal care and skilled birth attendance
- High rates of obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion or malpresentation
- Increased prevalence of uterine scarring from previous cesarean sections or other uterine surgeries
- Delayed referrals to higher-level healthcare facilities for emergency obstetric care

In contrast, the other options are less common causes of obstetric emergencies in Africa:
A. Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency, not specifically an obstetric emergency.
C. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix, but it is not a leading cause of obstetric emergencies in Africa.
D. Ectopic pregnancy, while a serious condition, is not a leading cause of obstetric emergencies in Africa.
E. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder, but it is not the most common cause of obstetric emergencies in Africa.

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Hemorrhage.

Rationale:
Hemorrhage, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, is the leading cause of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hemorrhage accounts for approximately 27% of maternal deaths in this region.

Postpartum hemorrhage, defined as excessive bleeding after childbirth, can occur due to various reasons, such as uterine atony, placental abnormalities, birth canal lacerations, or coagulation disorders. Timely recognition and management of hemorrhage are crucial to prevent maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to quality obstetric care can be limited.

B.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
C.  Iron deficiency anemia
D.  Hereditary spherocytosis
E.  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).

Rationale:
The patient's presentation of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, along with the laboratory findings of normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), are most consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).

In AIHA, the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack and destroy the patient's own red blood cells, leading to hemolysis and anemia. The normocytic anemia and positive DAT are characteristic of this condition.

The other options are less likely:
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurological symptoms, which are not the primary features in this case.
- Iron deficiency anemia would not typically present with thrombocytopenia.
- Hereditary spherocytosis is a congenital red blood cell membrane disorder, which is less likely in a 60-year-old African patient.

African endemic yaws is a chronic, contagious, non-venereal disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. The common manifestations of African endemic yaws include:

A. Painful genital ulcers - This is not a common manifestation of African endemic yaws, as the disease primarily affects the skin, bones, and joints, and does not typically involve the genital area.
B. Bony deformities - This is a common manifestation of African endemic yaws, as the disease can lead to the development of bony deformities, particularly in the long bones and joints.
C. Painless chancre - This is not a common manifestation of African endemic yaws, as the disease does not typically present with a painless chancre, which is more commonly associated with syphilis.
D. Recurrent fever - This is not a common manifestation of African endemic yaws, as the disease is not typically associated with recurrent fever.

There are several reasons for this. Many infectious diseases, increase the nutritional needs of the body. The body requires additional energy and nutrients to fight off the infection, leading to increased nutrient demands.They can also lead to loss of appetite, reduced food intake, and impaired nutrient absorption. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and other symptoms associated with infections can contribute to poor appetite and decreased absorption of nutrients from the diet. Certain infectious diseases, particularly diarrheal diseases, can cause significant nutrient loss through vomiting and diarrhea. This leads to a depletion of essential nutrients from the body. Finally, some infections can interfere with nutrient utilization and metabolism. For example, malaria can disrupt the body's ability to use nutrients effectively, leading to malnutrition.",5,C,Lack of access to food,Poor sanitation,Infectious diseases,Lack of education,Political instability,"###Instruction: The following are multiple choice questions (MCQs).

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Infectious diseases.

Rationale:
Infectious diseases are the most common cause of malnutrition in children in Africa. Diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, and respiratory infections can lead to poor nutrient absorption, increased nutrient requirements, and decreased appetite, all of which contribute to malnutrition.

While other factors like lack of access to food, poor sanitation, lack of education, and political instability can also contribute to malnutrition, infectious diseases are the primary driver in many African countries. Infectious diseases can impair a child's ability to properly utilize the nutrients they consume, leading to malnutrition even in the presence of adequate food availability.",C,True,0.3680981545635892,0.11659192334774497,0.3190183999623622,0.8837925,0.89031756,0.88704306

Acute pancreatitis is not the commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria. The most common causes of acute abdomen in Nigeria are:

1. Acute appendicitis
2. Intestinal obstruction
3. Perforated peptic ulcer
4. Acute cholecystitis

Acute pancreatitis, while a significant cause of acute abdomen, is not the most common one in the Nigerian population.

###Options:
A.  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
B.  Miliary tuberculosis
C.  Schistosomiasis
D.  Trypanosomiasis
E.  Malaria

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. Malaria.

Rationale:
The key features in this case are:
- Recent travel to East Africa
- Cough, fever (particularly at night), myalgia, headache
- Itchy rash
- Lack of consistent antimalarial prophylaxis
- Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray
- Eosinophilia on FBC

The most likely diagnosis based on these findings is malaria. Malaria is a common parasitic infection acquired through the bite of an infected mosquito, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions like East Africa. The symptoms of fever, chills, myalgia, and headache are classic for malaria. The pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia can also be seen in some forms of malaria, such as Plasmodium falciparum infection.

The other options are less likely:
A. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare vasculitis condition that typically presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and multiorgan involvement, which is not the case here.
B. Miliary tuberculosis can present with fever, cough, and pulmonary infiltrates, but the recent travel history and lack of other typical TB symptoms make this less likely.
C. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection acquired through contact with contaminated freshwater, which is not mentioned in the history.
D. Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) is transmitted by the tsetse fly and is more common in Central Africa, not East Africa.

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Secondary immunodeficiency.

Rationale:
HIV/AIDS is a type of secondary immunodeficiency, where the immune system is compromised due to an acquired infection or disease. In the case of HIV/AIDS, the virus targets and destroys the CD4+ T cells, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system.

In Africa, HIV/AIDS is a major public health concern and is commonly associated with secondary immunodeficiency. The high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in many African countries has led to a significant burden of secondary immunodeficiency, which can increase the risk of opportunistic infections and other complications.

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. Tuberculosis.

Rationale:
Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of chronic cough in Africa. This is due to the high prevalence of TB in many African countries, where it remains a significant public health concern.

In Africa, the incidence of TB is much higher compared to other regions of the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the African region accounted for about 25% of the global TB burden in 2020. The high rates of TB in Africa are often attributed to factors such as poverty, limited access to healthcare, and the co-occurrence of HIV/AIDS, which can increase the risk of developing active TB.

###Options:
A.  IgA
B.  IgD
C.  IgE
D.  IgG
E.  IgM

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. IgE.

Rationale:
The symptoms described, including hives, angioedema, and wheezing, are characteristic of an immediate, type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is mediated by the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody.

In an IgE-mediated allergic reaction, the allergen (in this case, seafood) binds to IgE antibodies that are attached to mast cells and basophils. This cross-linking of IgE triggers the release of various inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which lead to the observed symptoms.

IgA, IgD, IgG, and IgM are not primarily involved in this type of immediate allergic reaction. IgA is primarily involved in mucosal immunity, IgD has a less well-defined role, IgG is involved in various immune responses but not typically in immediate allergies, and IgM is the first antibody produced in response to an antigen.

A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Avascular necrosis
D.  Septic arthritis

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Osteoarthritis.

Rationale:
The patient's presentation of chronic hip pain and stiffness, which is worse with weight-bearing and relieved by rest, along with the imaging findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, are characteristic of osteoarthritis.

Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis, and it is characterized by the gradual breakdown and eventual loss of the articular cartilage within a joint. This leads to the development of bony changes, such as subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation, as the body attempts to compensate for the loss of cartilage.

The other options are less likely in this case:
- Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with symmetric, inflammatory joint involvement, which is not the case here.
- Avascular necrosis is more commonly associated with a history of trauma or steroid use, which is not mentioned in the case.

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Plasmodium falciparum.

Rationale:
Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent malaria parasite in Africa. It is the most deadly and severe form of malaria, responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

Plasmodium falciparum is the dominant malaria parasite in Africa, accounting for approximately 99.7% of malaria cases on the continent. It is the primary cause of severe and complicated malaria, leading to complications such as cerebral malaria, severe anemia, and multi-organ failure, which can be fatal if not treated promptly and effectively.

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria, as well as in many other parts of the world. Acute appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small, pouch-like structure attached to the first part of the large intestine. It is a common surgical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications such as perforation and peritonitis.

In Nigeria, as in many other developing countries, acute appendicitis is a leading cause of acute abdominal pain and is one of the most common indications for emergency abdominal surgery.

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).

Rationale:

The first-line management for menorrhagia in this patient would be the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). This is a more conservative approach compared to hysterectomy, which should be considered as a last resort.

The key reasons for this recommendation are:

1. The patient is relatively young (39 years old) and has no other significant pelvic pathology, so a hysterectomy (options A and B) would be an overly aggressive approach.

2. The LNG-IUS is an effective and reversible treatment for menorrhagia, with the added benefit of being well-tolerated in patients with Crohn's disease who are taking oral sulphasalazine.

3. Injectable progestogens (option D) and the progesterone-only pill (option E) are also options, but the LNG-IUS is generally considered more effective for the management of menorrhagia.

E.  The target of MDGS is to reduce maternal mortality ratio by 50% by 2015

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disease, abortion, and obstructed labor.

Rationale:
A. Kenya has not yet attained the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for maternal mortality. The maternal mortality ratio in Kenya remains high, estimated at 362 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014, which is far from the MDG target of 147 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015.

B. Death from HIV in pregnancy is not considered a direct maternal death. Direct maternal deaths are those resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labor, and the puerperium), from interventions, omissions, or incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above.

C. This is the correct answer. The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disease, abortion, and obstructed labor.

D. Maternal mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio are not the same. The maternal mortality rate is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 women of reproductive age, while the maternal mortality ratio is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Depo medroxy progesterone acetate (DMPA).

Rationale:
According to the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, the most commonly used contraceptive method in Kenya is the injectable contraceptive, specifically Depo medroxy progesterone acetate (DMPA). The survey found that 39% of married women in Kenya were using DMPA, making it the most prevalent contraceptive method in the country.

DMPA is a highly effective, long-acting, and reversible contraceptive option that is administered as an intramuscular injection every three months. It is a popular choice among Kenyan women due to its convenience, high efficacy, and lack of requirement for daily adherence compared to other methods like oral contraceptive pills.

D.  d.	To start steroids
E.  e.	Watchful waiting

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Refer to the public health specialist for start of anti-TB.

Rationale:
Tuberculosis (TB) of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a rare manifestation of extrapulmonary TB, and it typically responds well to standard anti-TB treatment. The appropriate intervention for this patient is to refer them to a public health specialist for the initiation of anti-TB therapy.

Option A (Prepare for resection of the ileum to prevent spread) is not the most appropriate intervention. Surgical resection is generally not the first-line treatment for GIT TB, as the lesions typically respond well to anti-TB medications.

Option B (Resect the ileum and the adjacent jejunum and ascending colon) is also not the most appropriate intervention. Extensive surgical resection is usually not necessary for GIT TB, and it should be reserved for cases with complications, such as obstruction, perforation, or bleeding, that do not respond to medical treatment.

Option D (To start steroids) is not the most appropriate intervention. Steroids are not the primary treatment for GIT TB and should only be considered in specific situations, such as when there is a risk of intestinal obstruction or perforation.

Option E (Watchful waiting) is not the most appropriate intervention. GIT TB requires prompt treatment with anti-TB medications to prevent complications and further spread of the disease.

In summary, the most appropriate intervention for this patient is to refer them to a public health specialist for the initiation of standard anti-TB therapy, as this is the primary and most effective treatment for GIT TB.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7363953,0.8480778,0.7883005

D.  d.	All the above
E.  e.	None of the above

###Answer:","The correct answer is: D. All the above

Rationale:
Colorectal cancers are relatively less frequent in Africa compared to other regions for the following reasons:

A. The young age of the population: Africa has a younger population, with a median age of around 19 years, compared to other regions. Colorectal cancer is more common in older age groups, so the younger population in Africa contributes to the lower incidence of colorectal cancer.

B. Large intake of high-fiber diet which shortens the transit time of feces: The traditional African diet is typically high in fiber, which can help to shorten the transit time of feces through the colon. This reduced transit time may help to limit the exposure of the colon to potential carcinogens, thereby reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.

C. Rarity of precancerous lesions like Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis: Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are known risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer. These conditions are relatively rare in Africa, which may contribute to the lower incidence of colorectal cancer in the region.

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Sigmoid volvulus.

Rationale:
Sigmoid volvulus is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction in Africa. Volvulus occurs when the sigmoid colon twists around its mesentery, leading to obstruction and potential ischemia of the bowel.

In Africa, the high prevalence of sigmoid volvulus is attributed to several factors, including:
- High-fiber diet leading to a long, redundant sigmoid colon
- Chronic constipation
- Lack of access to healthcare and delayed presentation
- Anatomical predisposition, with a long, narrow sigmoid mesocolon

In Ghana, the most common cause of small bowel obstruction is band and adhesions. This is due to the high incidence of previous abdominal surgeries, which can lead to the formation of adhesions and bands that can cause mechanical obstruction of the small intestine.

Strangulated inguinal hernia, intussusception, adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, and volvulus are other potential causes of small bowel obstruction, but they are less common in the Ghanaian context compared to band and adhesions.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75628537,0.86431277,0.80669856

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Anti-retroviral drugs should be started first.

Rationale:
In the case of HIV-TB co-infection, the recommended approach is to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) first, followed by anti-tuberculous treatment.

The rationale for this is:

1. Starting ART first helps to improve the patient's immune function, which is crucial for the effective treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Delaying ART can lead to a higher risk of mortality in HIV-TB co-infected patients.

2. Initiating ART first also helps to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which can occur when ART is started too early in the course of TB treatment.

3. Delaying ART until after the completion of the initial phase of TB treatment (2 months) is associated with a higher risk of mortality compared to starting ART earlier.

E.  CD2 lymphocytes

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. CD4 lymphocytes.

Rationale:
During the course of HIV infection, the virus primarily targets and infects CD4+ T lymphocytes, also known as T-helper cells. CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in the body's immune response, coordinating and regulating various immune functions.

HIV specifically targets and binds to the CD4 receptor on the surface of these cells, using it as the primary entry point to infect and replicate within the host cell. As the infection progresses, the number of functional CD4+ T cells decreases, leading to the characteristic immunodeficiency seen in AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), the advanced stage of HIV infection.

The other options are incorrect:
A. CD3 lymphocytes: CD3 is a marker found on all T cells, including both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but HIV does not specifically target CD3+ cells.
C. NK cells: Natural Killer (NK) cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte that are part of the innate immune system, and they are not the primary target of HIV infection.
D. T-helper cells: This is the correct answer, as T-helper cells are synonymous with CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are the primary target of HIV.

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Core Antigen.

Rationale:
The core antigen, also known as the p24 antigen, is a key marker for the diagnosis of HIV infection. It is a protein that is part of the core of the HIV virus and is produced in large quantities during the early stages of HIV infection.

The presence of the core antigen in the blood is an indication that the HIV virus is actively replicating and infecting the host's cells. This makes it a reliable marker for the detection of HIV infection, especially in the early stages when antibodies may not yet be detectable.

Rationale:
In cryptococcal meningitis, serial lumbar punctures are often recommended to help reduce intracranial pressure. Cryptococcal meningitis is a serious fungal infection of the meninges, and the increased intracranial pressure can lead to life-threatening complications if not properly managed.

Performing serial lumbar punctures helps to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lower the intracranial pressure, which can provide symptomatic relief and improve outcomes for patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

D.  Bone
E.  Miliary TB

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Cervical lymph nodes.

Rationale:
Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) refers to tuberculosis (TB) that occurs in sites other than the lungs. The most common site for extrapulmonary tuberculosis is the cervical lymph nodes, also known as tuberculous lymphadenitis or scrofula.

The reasons why cervical lymph nodes are the most common site for EPTB include:
1. The lymphatic system is a common route for the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the primary site of infection in the lungs.
2. The head and neck region, including the cervical lymph nodes, have a rich lymphatic drainage, making them vulnerable to lymphatic spread of the infection.
3. The cervical lymph nodes are more accessible for clinical examination and biopsy, leading to a higher rate of diagnosis compared to other extrapulmonary sites.

###Options:
A.  GeneXpert
B.  Sputum for AAFBs
C.  TB LAM test
D.  Chest radiograph
E.  Sputum culture and sensitivity

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. GeneXpert.

Rationale:
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of GeneXpert as the initial diagnostic test for adult pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in settings where TB and/or HIV is prevalent, such as Kenya. GeneXpert is a rapid molecular test that can detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and identify resistance to rifampicin, a key first-line anti-TB drug, within a few hours.

The advantages of GeneXpert over other diagnostic tests include:
- Rapid turnaround time (within 2 hours)
- Ability to detect both TB and rifampicin resistance
- Higher sensitivity compared to sputum smear microscopy
- Suitability for use in resource-limited settings

In contrast, the other options have the following limitations:
- Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears (option B) have lower sensitivity, especially in HIV-positive individuals.
- TB LAM test (option C) is primarily used for the diagnosis of TB in people living with HIV, not for general adult pulmonary TB.
- Chest radiograph (option D) is not a definitive diagnostic test and requires further confirmation.
- Sputum culture and sensitivity (option E) is a more complex and time-consuming test, not suitable as a first-line diagnostic tool.

Therefore, the recommended first-line diagnostic test for adult pulmonary tuberculosis in Kenya is the GeneXpert assay.",A,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7363508,0.85265654,0.79024714

B.  d)	It reduces TB meningitis
C.  d)	It reduces TB meningitis
D.  d)	It reduces TB meningitis
E.  e)	It reduces TB adenitis

###Answer:","The correct answer is A) It reduces TB meningitis.

Rationale:
The BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for routine immunization of newborns in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB), such as Malawi. One of the key effects of the BCG vaccine that leads to its recommendation is its ability to reduce the risk of TB meningitis.

TB meningitis is a severe form of TB that affects the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and it can be particularly devastating in young children. Studies have shown that the BCG vaccine can provide significant protection against the development of TB meningitis, with a reduction in the risk of up to 64% in some settings.

The other options (B, C, and D) are incorrect, as they all state the same answer, which is not the correct one. Option E, ""It reduces TB adenitis,"" is also incorrect, as the BCG vaccine is not primarily recommended for its effect on reducing TB adenitis (swelling of the lymph nodes).

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. High glucose levels.

Rationale:
In bacterial meningitis, the expected findings in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) include:

A. Pleocytosis (increased white blood cell count): This is a characteristic finding in bacterial meningitis, as the immune system responds to the infection by increasing the number of white blood cells in the CSF.

C. Positive latex agglutination: This test can detect the presence of bacterial antigens in the CSF, which helps in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.

D. High protein levels: The inflammation and disruption of the blood-brain barrier in bacterial meningitis leads to an increase in the protein content of the CSF.

E. Absent red blood cells: Bacterial meningitis does not typically cause the presence of red blood cells in the CSF, unlike some other conditions like traumatic lumbar puncture or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Endotracheal intubation for 5 days.

Rationale:
A. Alcoholism is a known risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia. Alcohol abuse can impair the immune system and increase the risk of developing pneumonia.

B. Diabetes is a risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia. Diabetes can weaken the immune system and increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections.

C. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with COPD have compromised lung function, making them more vulnerable to respiratory infections.

D. Endotracheal intubation for 5 days is not a risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia. Endotracheal intubation is more commonly associated with the development of hospital-acquired (or ventilator-associated) pneumonia, not community-acquired pneumonia.

E. Steroid use is a risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia. Steroid medications can suppress the immune system, increasing the risk of respiratory infections.

The Rome criteria are a set of diagnostic guidelines developed by the Rome Foundation, an international organization of experts in functional gastrointestinal disorders.

The Rome criteria for IBS include the following:
- Recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months, associated with two or more of the following:
  - Improvement with defecation
  - Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool
  - Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool
- Symptoms must have started at least 6 months prior to diagnosis.

The other options are not the accepted diagnostic criteria for IBS:
- A. Boston criteria are not used for IBS diagnosis.
- C. Munich criteria are not used for IBS diagnosis.
- D. Helsinki criteria are not used for IBS diagnosis.
- E. Nairobi criteria are not used for IBS diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Rome criteria, as they are the established diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.74858123,0.8505486,0.79631394

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months.

Rationale:
A. Universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is not mandatory for all patients. It is recommended for patients with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/μL or with a history of opportunistic infections.
B. Dapsone can be used as an alternative to Cotrimoxazole when it is contraindicated, but it should not be continued indefinitely. The prophylaxis can be discontinued when the CD4 count is maintained above 200 cells/μL for at least 6 months.
C. This statement is correct. Primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) can be discontinued when the CD4 count is maintained above 200 cells/μL for more than 6 months.

E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. A repeat viral load should be done in 6 months and if similar levels are obtained, he should be switched to a second-line regimen.

Rationale:
A. An intercurrent infection can cause a transient increase in viral load, but this is unlikely to persist for 6 years with an undetectable viral load.
B. Adherence counseling and directly observed treatment are not the appropriate next steps, as the patient has been on a stable regimen for 6 years with undetectable viral loads.
C. This is the correct answer. A single viral load of 245 copies/ml in a patient with a history of undetectable viral loads on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) warrants a repeat viral load in 6 months. If the viral load remains elevated, it would indicate virologic failure, and the patient should be switched to a second-line regimen.
D. The viremia would not be expected to continue rising with time, as the patient has been on a stable regimen for 6 years with undetectable viral loads.

B.  Transverse myelitis
C.  Poliomyelitis
D.  Miller-Fisher syndrome
E.  Botulism

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Miller-Fisher syndrome.

Rationale:
The key features in this case are:
- Acute onset ascending weakness of the lower limbs
- Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the eye muscles)
- Ataxic gait (uncoordinated, unsteady walking)
- Preceding upper respiratory tract infection

These clinical features are highly suggestive of Miller-Fisher syndrome, a rare variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Miller-Fisher syndrome is characterized by the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia (absent deep tendon reflexes), often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection.

B.  Clostridium tetani
C.  Campylobacter jejuni
D.  Streptococcus pneumoniae
E.  Vibrio cholerae

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Campylobacter jejuni.

Rationale:
The clinical presentation of acute onset ascending paralysis following a preceding diarrheal illness is most consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is commonly associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection.

Campylobacter jejuni is a common cause of gastroenteritis and has been identified as the most frequent antecedent infection in GBS cases. The preceding diarrheal illness and the development of flaccid weakness of the lower limbs are characteristic features of GBS, which is an autoimmune-mediated disorder triggered by molecular mimicry between Campylobacter jejuni antigens and peripheral nerve components.

The other options are not the most likely causative organisms for this presentation:
A. Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever, which is not typically associated with ascending paralysis.
B. Clostridium tetani causes tetanus, which presents with muscle spasms and rigidity, not flaccid paralysis.
D. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia and meningitis, but not typically associated with GBS.

C.  Secretory
D.  Infective
E.  Dysmotility

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Secretory.

Rationale:
Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which produces a potent enterotoxin called cholera toxin. This toxin acts on the intestinal epithelial cells, leading to a secretory diarrhea mechanism.

The cholera toxin activates the adenylate cyclase enzyme, which increases the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) within the intestinal epithelial cells. Elevated cAMP levels stimulate the secretion of chloride ions (Cl-) and water into the intestinal lumen, resulting in the characteristic watery, voluminous diarrhea seen in cholera.

This secretory mechanism is the primary cause of the severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance observed in cholera patients. The other options do not accurately describe the mechanism of diarrhea in cholera.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.74611545,0.8602346,0.7991214

E.  Appendicitis is not common in sub Saharan Africa

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Complicated appendicitis is less frequent than in Western countries.

Rationale:
A. Complicated appendicitis is less frequent than in Western countries.
This option is correct. Studies have shown that in sub-Saharan Africa, complicated appendicitis (such as perforated or gangrenous appendicitis) is less common compared to Western countries. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including earlier presentation to healthcare facilities, better access to healthcare, and lower rates of obesity.

B. A majority of patients present with the classic symptoms of vague periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant with anorexia followed by nausea and vomiting.
This option is not correct. In sub-Saharan Africa, the presentation of appendicitis may differ from the classic textbook description. Patients often present with atypical symptoms, such as right iliac fossa pain, which is the most common symptom.

C. Patients have a shorter duration of symptoms than in Western countries.
This option is not correct. Studies have shown that patients in sub-Saharan Africa often have a longer duration of symptoms before seeking medical care, which can contribute to the development of complicated appendicitis.

D. Right iliac fossa pain is the most common symptom.

###Question: A 49-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a seizure. He does not have a history of seizures and he currently takes no medications. He has AIDS and is not under any care at this time. His physical examination is most notable for small, shoddy lymphadenopathy in the cervical region. A head CT shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe, with edema but no mass effect. A lumbar puncture shows no white or red blood cells, and the Gram stain is negative. His serum Toxoplasma IgG is positive. Which of the following is the best course of action for this patient at this time?
###Options:
A.  Biopsy of the central nervous system (CNS) lesion
B.  Dexamethasone
C.  Search for systemic malignancy
D.  Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis
E.  Whole-brain radiation therapy

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis.

Rationale:
The patient presents with a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe, positive Toxoplasma IgG, and no other significant findings on the lumbar puncture. This strongly suggests a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS.

The best course of action in this case is to initiate treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis. This typically involves a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, with or without folinic acid, which is the standard treatment for this condition.

The other options are not the best course of action in this scenario:

A. Biopsy of the CNS lesion is not necessary, as the clinical and radiographic findings, along with the positive Toxoplasma IgG, are highly suggestive of CNS toxoplasmosis.

B. Dexamethasone is not the first-line treatment and should only be used in cases with significant edema or mass effect, which are not mentioned in the case.

C. Searching for systemic malignancy is not the priority, as the patient's presentation is most consistent with CNS toxoplasmosis.

E. Whole-brain radiation therapy is not the appropriate treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis, which is typically managed with antimicrobial therapy.

In summary, the best course of action for this patient is to initiate treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis, as this is the most likely diagnosis based on the presented information.",D,True,0.017094016757980866,0.0,0.017094016757980866,0.73449755,0.8495729,0.7878553

###Question: What is the commonest cause of peptic ulcer disease in Malawi? 





###Options:
A.  Alcohol
B.  H.pylori
C.  Genetics
D.  Idiopathic

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. H.pylori.

Rationale:
Peptic ulcer disease is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by the presence of ulcers or sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum. In Malawi, as in many other parts of the world, the most common cause of peptic ulcer disease is infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

H. pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium that can colonize the gastric mucosa and disrupt the protective mechanisms of the stomach, leading to the development of peptic ulcers. It is estimated that up to 80% of peptic ulcers in Malawi are caused by H. pylori infection.

The other options are less common causes of peptic ulcer disease:
A. Alcohol: Excessive alcohol consumption can irritate the stomach lining and contribute to the development of peptic ulcers, but it is not the most common cause.
C. Genetics: While genetic factors may play a role in the susceptibility to peptic ulcers, they are not the primary cause.
D. Idiopathic: Peptic ulcers with no identifiable cause are considered idiopathic, but this is a relatively rare occurrence compared to H. pylori infection.

###Options:
A.  Nephrotic syndrome
B.  Disseminated TB
C.  HIV associated nephropathy
D.  Acute kidney injury

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. HIV associated nephropathy.

Rationale:
The key findings in this case are:
- Swelling of the lower extremities, face, and body (anasarca)
- Proteinuria (3+ on urine dipstick)
- Hematuria (1+ on urine dipstick)
- Hypoalbuminemia
- Positive HIV status

These findings are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is a common manifestation of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a kidney disease that can occur in individuals with HIV infection, especially those with advanced disease and low CD4 counts.

The other options are less likely:
A. Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by various etiologies, not just HIVAN.
B. Disseminated TB is less likely as the patient does not have any history of infections.
D. Acute kidney injury is less likely as the presentation is more chronic with anasarca and nephrotic-range proteinuria.

###Options:
A.  Trauma
B.  Tuberculosis
C.  Streptococcus pneumoniae
D.  Idiopathic

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Tuberculosis.

Rationale:
In low-resource countries like Malawi, the most common cause of pericardial effusion is tuberculosis (TB). Tuberculosis is a major public health concern in many developing countries, and it can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, resulting in a pericardial effusion.

Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and it can affect various organs, including the pericardium (the protective sac surrounding the heart). Tuberculosis pericarditis is a common manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and can lead to the development of a pericardial effusion.

The other options are less likely to be the commonest cause of pericardial effusion in low-resource countries:

A. Trauma: While trauma can cause pericardial effusion, it is not the most common cause in low-resource settings like Malawi.
C. Streptococcus pneumoniae: Pneumococcal pericarditis is a less common cause of pericardial effusion compared to tuberculosis in these regions.
D. Idiopathic: Pericardial effusions of unknown cause (idiopathic) are less likely to be the most common cause in low-resource countries, where infectious diseases like tuberculosis are more prevalent.

D.  D.Urinalysis showing blood in urine

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Blantyre coma score of 4/5.

Rationale:
The Blantyre coma score is a tool used to assess the severity of cerebral malaria in children. It evaluates the child's ability to localize a painful stimulus, their motor response, and their verbal response. A score of 4/5 or less indicates severe malaria and a high risk of mortality.

Chills and rigors (option A) are common symptoms of malaria but do not necessarily indicate the severity of the condition.

A blood sugar of 1.4 (option B) is extremely low and could be a sign of severe malaria, but it is not the primary indicator of severity used in this case.

The presence of blood in the urine (option D) may indicate a complication of malaria, such as blackwater fever, but it is not the primary measure of severity used in this question.

###Options:
A.  Myocardial infraction
B.  Ascites
C.  Pneumonia
D.  Stroke
E.  . Head Injury

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Ascites.

Rationale:
The urinary D-xylose test is used to assess the integrity of the small intestinal mucosa in malabsorption syndromes. This test involves the oral administration of D-xylose, a monosaccharide that is absorbed primarily in the small intestine. The amount of D-xylose excreted in the urine over a specific time period (typically 5 hours) is then measured.

In malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease or tropical sprue, the absorption of D-xylose is impaired, leading to a decreased urinary excretion of the sugar. Therefore, a low urinary D-xylose level is indicative of small intestinal mucosal damage or dysfunction.

However, the presence of ascites can lead to a false-positive result in the urinary D-xylose test. Ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, can interfere with the absorption and distribution of the D-xylose, resulting in a higher urinary excretion of the sugar, even in the absence of small intestinal mucosal damage.

In contrast, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, stroke, and head injury are not known to directly affect the urinary D-xylose test results, and therefore, they would not give a false-positive result.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.733155,0.85535955,0.7895567

Rationale:
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can affect the absorption of various medications by altering the gastric pH.
- Iron absorption is decreased by PPIs due to the increased gastric pH, which reduces the solubility of iron.
- Ampicillin absorption is also decreased by PPIs, as the increased pH can lead to reduced dissolution and absorption of the antibiotic.
- Ketoconazole is a weak base, and its absorption is reduced in the presence of increased gastric pH caused by PPIs.
- Digoxin, on the other hand, is not significantly affected by changes in gastric pH caused by PPIs. Digoxin is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, and its absorption is not dependent on the gastric pH.

Rationale:
Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by a type of flatworm called a schistosome. The life cycle of schistosomiasis involves two hosts: an intermediate host (freshwater snails) and a definitive host (humans).

The intermediate host in the life cycle of schistosomiasis is the freshwater snail. The schistosome parasite undergoes several developmental stages within the snail, which serves as a crucial part of the parasite's life cycle. The snail acts as a host for the parasite's larval stages, allowing the parasite to multiply and develop before being released into the water, where they can then infect the definitive human host.

Humans are the definitive host in the life cycle of schistosomiasis, as the adult worms live and reproduce within the human body. Fishes and dogs are not involved in the life cycle of schistosomiasis.

E.  direct host cell killing by the bacillus

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. hypersensitivity response to products of TB bacteria.

Rationale:
The pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. TB) is primarily due to the host's hypersensitivity response to the products and components of the TB bacteria, rather than the direct killing of host cells by the bacillus.

Explanation:
A. Impaired antibody response/cell-mediated response: While the cell-mediated immune response is crucial in controlling M. TB infection, the pathogenicity is not primarily due to impaired immune responses.
B. Hypersensitivity response to products of TB bacteria: This is the correct answer. M. TB is an intracellular pathogen that can evade the host's immune system. The host's hypersensitivity response to the bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharides and proteins, leads to the formation of granulomas and tissue damage, which contributes to the pathogenicity of M. TB.
C. Due to expanding granuloma: Granuloma formation is a host response to M. TB infection, but it is not the primary cause of pathogenicity. Granulomas can actually help contain the infection in some cases.
D. Due to caseous necrosis: Caseous necrosis is a consequence of the host's immune response to M. TB, but it is not the primary cause of the pathogenicity.

###Options:
A.  Displacement
B.  Replacement
C.  Suppression
D.  Repression
E.  Expression

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Displacement.

Rationale:
Displacement is a defense mechanism where an individual redirects their emotions or feelings from the original source to a less threatening or more accessible target. In this case, George was upset and frustrated with his coach's criticism during football training, but he did not express those emotions directly to his coach. Instead, he took out his anger on his cat, which is a less threatening target.

Displacement allows individuals to release pent-up emotions or feelings in a socially acceptable way, even though the target is not the original source of the emotion. In this scenario, George's anger towards his coach was displaced onto his cat, which is a common example of displacement.

The other options are not the most appropriate in this context:
- Replacement involves substituting one behavior or emotion with another, which is not the case here.
- Suppression involves consciously trying to push down or ignore emotions, which is different from displacement.
- Repression is the unconscious process of pushing emotions or memories into the subconscious, which is not what is happening in this situation.

###Options:
A.  Praziquantel
B.  Dapsone
C.  DEC
D.  Doxycycline
E.  Ivermectin

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. Ivermectin.

Rationale:
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. The treatment of choice for onchocerciasis is Ivermectin.

Ivermectin is a highly effective and safe drug that kills the microfilariae (immature worms) of Onchocerca volvulus. It is the recommended first-line treatment for onchocerciasis by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The other options are not the primary treatments for onchocerciasis:
A. Praziquantel is used to treat other parasitic infections, such as schistosomiasis, but not onchocerciasis.
B. Dapsone is an antibiotic used for the treatment of leprosy, not onchocerciasis.
C. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) was previously used to treat onchocerciasis, but it is no longer the recommended first-line treatment due to the risk of severe adverse reactions, especially in areas where Loa loa (another filarial parasite) is co-endemic.
D. Doxycycline is used to treat certain bacterial infections, but it is not the primary treatment for onchocerciasis.

###Options:
A.  vitamin b

C.  vitamin a
D.  vitamin e
E.  vitamin d

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. vitamin A.

Rationale:
Night blindness, also known as nyctalopia, is a condition characterized by the inability to see well in low light or darkness. This condition is primarily caused by a deficiency of vitamin A.

Vitamin A plays a crucial role in the functioning of the retina, which is responsible for vision. Specifically, vitamin A is required for the production of rhodopsin, a light-sensitive pigment found in the rod cells of the retina. Rhodopsin is essential for the eye's ability to adapt to low-light conditions and see in the dark.

When there is a deficiency of vitamin A, the production of rhodopsin is impaired, leading to the development of night blindness. This condition can also be associated with other eye-related problems, such as dry eyes and corneal damage.

In contrast, the other options (A, B, D, and E) are not directly associated with the development of night blindness. Vitamin B, C, D, and E deficiencies can cause various other health issues, but they are not the primary causes of night blindness.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. vitamin A.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75173354,0.85345834,0.7993726

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase).

Rationale:
In distinguishing between acute and chronic liver disease, the key laboratory parameter to focus on is the relative elevation of the liver enzymes, specifically ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) and AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase).

In acute liver injury, such as viral hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury, the ALT levels are typically much higher than the AST levels. This is because ALT is more specific to the liver, while AST can also be elevated in other conditions affecting the heart, muscles, or kidneys.

In chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis or chronic viral hepatitis, the AST levels are usually higher than or equal to the ALT levels. This is because in chronic liver disease, there is more damage to the hepatocytes, leading to a relative increase in AST compared to ALT.

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Zone 3.

Rationale:
Yellow fever virus is a hepatotropic arbovirus of the flavivirus genus, which primarily affects the hepatocytes in the centrilobular region or zone 3 of the hepatic acinus.

The hepatic acinus is divided into three zones based on the oxygen and nutrient gradients:
- Zone 1 (periportal): Highest oxygen and nutrient levels
- Zone 2 (midzonal): Intermediate oxygen and nutrient levels
- Zone 3 (centrilobular): Lowest oxygen and nutrient levels

Yellow fever virus has a predilection for the hepatocytes in zone 3, as they are the most susceptible to the virus due to their lower oxygen and nutrient levels compared to the other zones. This selective tropism for the centrilobular region results in the characteristic pathological changes observed in yellow fever, such as massive centrilobular necrosis and apoptosis of hepatocytes.

###Options:
A.  Leprosy
B.  vitamin A deficiency
C.  Diabetes
D.  Trachoma
E.  Graves Disease

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Leprosy.

Rationale:
Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. One of the common complications of leprosy is the involvement of the facial nerves, particularly the orbicularis oculi muscle, which is responsible for closing the eyelids.

In leprosy, the involvement of the facial nerves can lead to paresis (weakness) of the orbicularis oculi muscle, resulting in lagophthalmos (inability to fully close the eyelids). This, in turn, can lead to exposure keratitis and an insensitive cornea, which can ultimately result in blindness if left untreated.

The other options are not directly associated with orbicularis oculi paresis and lagophthalmos leading to blindness:
- Vitamin A deficiency can cause dry eyes and corneal ulceration, but not specifically orbicularis oculi paresis.
- Diabetes can cause various eye complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, but not specifically orbicularis oculi paresis.
- Trachoma is a bacterial eye infection that can lead to scarring and blindness, but it does not primarily involve the orbicularis oculi muscle.
- Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that can cause thyroid eye disease, but it does not typically lead to orbicularis oculi paresis and lagophthalmos.

D.  10 years
E.  More than 10 years

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. More than 10 years.

Rationale:
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. The disease is transmitted by the blackfly vector, and if neither individuals nor the population are treated, vector control alone would need to be continued for an extended period to eliminate the disease from a designated region.

Without any treatment for the infected individuals or the population, the life cycle of the parasite would continue, and the blackfly vector would continue to transmit the infection. The adult worms in the human host can live for up to 15 years, and the microfilariae (immature worms) can persist in the skin for several years.

To effectively eliminate onchocerciasis through vector control alone, the control measures would need to be maintained for a period longer than the lifespan of the adult worms and the persistence of the microfilariae in the human population. This is typically estimated to be more than 10 years, as the parasite's life cycle and the dynamics of transmission in the absence of any treatment would require a sustained and prolonged vector control effort to interrupt the transmission and eliminate the disease from the designated region.

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Scabies.

Rationale:
The key features in this case are:
- Multiple papules and exudative lesions on the face, scalp, trunk
- Few vesicles on the palms and soles
- History of itchy lesions in the mother

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of scabies. Scabies is a highly contagious skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The characteristic lesions include papules, vesicles, and burrows, often found on the face, scalp, trunk, and extremities, including the palms and soles. The presence of similar symptoms in the mother also supports the diagnosis of scabies, as it is a highly transmissible condition.

The other options are less likely:
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome typically presents with more severe, widespread skin involvement and mucosal lesions, which is not the case here.
- Infantile eczema and seborrheic dermatitis would not typically present with the vesicular lesions on the palms and soles.

E.  none of them

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. None of them.

Rationale:
All the Plasmodium species that cause malaria (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae) typically exhibit the characteristic periodicity of fever in malaria. This periodic fever pattern is a hallmark of malaria and is observed in all the major Plasmodium species that infect humans.

The periodicity of fever in malaria is related to the synchronous rupture of infected red blood cells, which releases merozoites that then infect new red blood cells. This synchronized rupture of infected cells leads to the classic fever pattern observed in malaria, with periodic spikes in body temperature.

Therefore, none of the Plasmodium species listed in the options are less likely to show the characteristic periodicity of fever in malaria. All the major Plasmodium species that cause human malaria exhibit this periodic fever pattern as a key clinical feature of the disease.",E,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73546517,0.85616124,0.7912369

C.  chronic kidney disease
D.  hyperglycemia

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. metabolic acidosis.

Rationale:
Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria is the most severe and life-threatening form of malaria. One of the severe features of P. falciparum malaria is metabolic acidosis.

Metabolic acidosis occurs in severe P. falciparum malaria due to the following reasons:
1. Increased anaerobic glycolysis: The malaria parasite's invasion and destruction of red blood cells leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis, resulting in the production of lactic acid.
2. Impaired tissue perfusion: The sequestration of infected red blood cells in the microvasculature can lead to impaired tissue perfusion, further contributing to lactic acid accumulation.
3. Renal dysfunction: Acute kidney injury, which is common in severe P. falciparum malaria, can impair the kidneys' ability to excrete acids, leading to metabolic acidosis.

The other options are not considered severe features of P. falciparum malaria:
B. Metabolic alkalosis is not a typical feature of severe P. falciparum malaria.

###Options:
A.  Doxycyline
B.  Penicillin
C.  Phlocodeine
D.  Dextromethorphan
E.  Chlorpheniramine

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Doxycycline.

Rationale:
Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The primary treatment for cholera is the replacement of fluids and electrolytes lost through severe diarrhea and vomiting. Antibiotics, such as doxycycline, can be used as an adjunct to rehydration therapy to help reduce the duration and severity of the illness.

Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is effective against Vibrio cholerae and is commonly used to treat cholera. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thereby preventing the bacteria from multiplying and causing further infection.

The other options are not appropriate treatments for cholera:

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. 2 months of Rifampicin, Isoniazide, Pyrazinemide and Ethambutol; 4 months of Rifampicin and Isoniazide.

Rationale:
Tuberculosis is typically treated with a combination of antibiotics over an extended period of time. The standard treatment regimen for drug-sensitive tuberculosis consists of two phases:

1. Initial (intensive) phase: This phase lasts for 2 months and typically includes a combination of four drugs - Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol.

2. Continuation phase: This phase lasts for 4 months and typically includes a combination of two drugs - Rifampicin and Isoniazid.

The rationale for this treatment regimen is as follows:
- The initial phase with four drugs helps to rapidly kill the majority of the tuberculosis bacteria and prevent the development of drug resistance.
- The continuation phase with two drugs helps to eliminate any remaining bacteria and prevent relapse.

###Answer:","The correct answer is E. Pulmonary tuberculosis is often associated with HIV infection.

Rationale:
A. Circumcision is associated with lower rates of HIV infection amongst African men. This statement is correct. Numerous studies have shown that male circumcision can reduce the risk of HIV infection in African men by up to 60%.

B. Infection rates are generally higher in rural populations. This statement is incorrect. HIV infection rates are generally higher in urban areas of Africa compared to rural areas, due to factors such as higher population density, increased mobility, and greater access to commercial sex work.

C. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a more common presentation of AIDS than in Europe. This statement is incorrect. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a common opportunistic infection associated with AIDS, but its prevalence is not necessarily higher in Africa compared to Europe.

D. The provision of HIV testing kits is a priority for good case management. This statement is correct. Improving access to HIV testing is a crucial component of effective HIV/AIDS management, as it allows for early diagnosis and linkage to care and treatment.

Rationale:
- African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is caused by two subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei: T. b. gambiense (Gambian form) and T. b. rhodesiense (Rhodesian form).
- The Gambian form progresses more rapidly compared to the Rhodesian form. The Gambian form typically has a longer incubation period of 1-3 weeks, while the Rhodesian form has a shorter incubation period of 1-3 days.
- The Rhodesian form is associated with a more prominent chancre (a painless skin ulcer at the site of the infective tsetse fly bite), while the Gambian form may not have a visible chancre.
- Erythema chronicum migrans is not a characteristic feature of African trypanosomiasis, but rather of Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi.

D.  Urinary output does not affect the amount per day
E.  1.5 litres of 0.9% Saline is needed per day

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. 1.5 litres is insensible water loss per day.

Rationale:
A. Correct. The average insensible water loss in a healthy adult is around 1.5 liters per day. This includes water loss through the skin (perspiration) and the respiratory tract (breathing).

B. Incorrect. The recommended daily potassium intake for a healthy adult is 3.5-5.0 mmol/kg, which would be 245-350 mmol per day for a 70 kg individual.

C. Incorrect. Fluids containing colloids, such as albumin or hydroxyethyl starch, are typically used for volume resuscitation in cases of hypovolemia or shock, not for maintenance fluid requirements.

D. Incorrect. Urinary output is a significant factor in determining the daily fluid requirements, as it represents a major route of fluid loss.

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Neonatal conditions are the leading causes of Under-Five mortality.

Rationale:
A. Neonatal conditions are the leading causes of Under-Five mortality: This statement is correct. Neonatal conditions, such as preterm birth complications, intrapartum-related events, and infections, are the leading causes of under-five mortality globally.

B. Breast feeding is recommended to last the first six months of life: This statement is incorrect. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, followed by the introduction of appropriate complementary foods and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond.

C. 16% of newborns weigh <2.5kg at birth: This statement is incorrect. According to the WHO, the global prevalence of low birth weight (less than 2.5 kg) is around 15.5%.

D. Malaria is responsible for about 75% of childhood death: This statement is incorrect. While malaria is a significant contributor to childhood mortality, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, it is not responsible for 75% of childhood deaths.

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Pneumonia.

Rationale:
Congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children is commonly caused by pneumonia. Pneumonia can lead to increased work of breathing, which can subsequently cause strain on the heart and lead to congestive cardiac failure. Other common causes of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children include rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart defects (such as ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus), and cardiomyopathies.

The other options are less common causes of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children:
- Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect, but it is not a common cause of congestive cardiac failure in this population.
- Bronchial asthma is a respiratory condition and is not a direct cause of congestive cardiac failure.
- Transposition of the great arteries is a congenital heart defect, but it is not a common cause of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children.

E.  Vitamin K deficiency

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. G6PD deficiency.

Rationale:
G6PD deficiency is a common cause of neonatal anemia in Nigeria. G6PD deficiency is an inherited enzyme deficiency that can lead to hemolytic anemia, particularly in response to certain medications, infections, or oxidative stress.

In Nigeria, G6PD deficiency is relatively common, with a prevalence of around 10-20% in the general population. This high prevalence is due to the protective effect of G6PD deficiency against severe malaria, which is endemic in the region.

Other options are less common causes of neonatal anemia in Nigeria:
A. Hereditary elliptocytosis is a rare cause of neonatal anemia.
B. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is also a rare cause of neonatal anemia.
C. Beta-thalassemia is more common in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, but less prevalent in Nigeria.

D.  Cortical atrophy is the basic pathologic manifestation
E.  Mental retardation is a constant feature

###Answer:","The correct answer is A. Perinatal causes are commoner than prenatal causes in Africa.

Rationale:
A. Perinatal causes are commoner than prenatal causes in Africa:
This statement is correct. In Africa, perinatal factors, such as birth asphyxia, neonatal infections, and birth trauma, are more common causes of cerebral palsy compared to prenatal factors. Factors like maternal infections, placental abnormalities, and genetic conditions are less prevalent as causes of cerebral palsy in the African context.

B. Choreoathetoid is the commonest type in Africa:
This statement is incorrect. The most common type of cerebral palsy in Africa is the spastic type, not the choreoathetoid type.

C. Predominant cause in Nigeria is congenital toxoplasmosis:
This statement is incorrect. While congenital toxoplasmosis can be a cause of cerebral palsy, it is not the predominant cause in Nigeria. Perinatal factors, such as birth asphyxia and neonatal infections, are more common causes of cerebral palsy in Nigeria.

D. Cortical atrophy is the basic pathologic manifestation:
This statement is incorrect. The basic pathologic manifestation of cerebral palsy is not cortical atrophy. Cerebral palsy is characterized by various pathological changes, including white matter damage, gray matter injury, and abnormal brain development, depending on the underlying cause and timing of the insult.

E. Mental retardation is a constant feature:

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Oliguria.

Rationale:
Burkitt's lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is characterized by rapidly growing tumors, often involving the abdomen, kidneys, and other organs. The laboratory findings of hyperkalemia (serum potassium of 5.6 mmol/L) and hypocalcemia (serum calcium of 6.7 mg/dL) are consistent with tumor lysis syndrome, which is a common complication of Burkitt's lymphoma.

In tumor lysis syndrome, the rapid breakdown of tumor cells leads to the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid into the bloodstream, which can result in various clinical manifestations, including:

A. Bleeding gums: Not a common feature of tumor lysis syndrome.
B. Oliguria: Decreased urine output is a common feature of tumor lysis syndrome due to the accumulation of uric acid and phosphate, leading to the formation of crystals in the renal tubules and obstruction.
C. Inability to stand erect: Not a common feature of tumor lysis syndrome.
D. Severe pallor: Not a direct consequence of tumor lysis syndrome.

Rationale:
Painless hematuria (blood in the urine) is a common symptom of schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by the Schistosoma worm. In areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, such as rural primary schools in certain regions, it is the most likely cause of painless hematuria in a significant proportion of children.

D.  It is a sex-linked disorder.

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation.

Rationale:
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated sickle cell gene, one from each parent, to develop the disease.

A. Sickle cell disease is not inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In an autosomal dominant disorder, only one copy of the mutated gene is required to develop the condition.

B. Correct. In sickle cell disease, both copies of the hemoglobin gene (HBB) in each cell have a mutation, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin (hemoglobin S).

C. The most common variant of sickle cell disease is caused by a missense mutation, not a nonsense mutation. The sickle cell mutation involves a single amino acid substitution (glutamic acid to valine) in the hemoglobin molecule.

A.  Pulmonary oedema
B.  Acute renal insufficiency
C.  Haemoglobinuria
D.  Hyperbilirubinaemia

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Haemoglobinuria.

Rationale:
In a 2-year-old child presenting with a high fever (40.8°C) and the presence of asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum on a blood film, the most likely complication to be present is haemoglobinuria.

Haemoglobinuria is a common complication of severe falciparum malaria, particularly in children. It occurs due to the massive destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) infected by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, leading to the release of free hemoglobin into the bloodstream. This free hemoglobin is then filtered by the kidneys, resulting in the presence of hemoglobin in the urine (haemoglobinuria).

The other options are less likely to be the primary complication in this case:
A. Pulmonary edema is more commonly associated with severe malaria in adults, not typically in young children.
B. Acute renal insufficiency can occur in severe malaria, but it is not the most likely complication in a 2-year-old with this presentation.
D. Hyperbilirubinemia can occur due to the breakdown of RBCs, but it is not the most prominent feature in this case.

Rationale:
The given haematocrit levels of 23% to 26% in the population of rural primary school children in Nigeria are indicative of anemia. The most likely aetiology (cause) of this condition is iron deficiency anemia.

Iron deficiency anemia is a common form of anemia, particularly in developing countries, where dietary intake of iron may be inadequate. The low haematocrit levels (normal range is typically 36-48% for children) suggest a lack of sufficient red blood cells and hemoglobin, which is characteristic of iron deficiency anemia.

The other options are less likely:
A. Sickle cell anemia typically presents with lower hemoglobin levels and different red blood cell morphology.
C. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can cause hemolytic anemia, but the haematocrit range provided is not typical of this condition.

###Question: Which of the following vaccines is effective in the prevention of neonatal tetanus?





###Options:
A.  Pentavalent I, II and III
B.  Anti-Tetanus serum
C.  Measles
D.  Tetanus toxoid

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Tetanus toxoid.

Rationale:
Tetanus toxoid vaccine is the most effective vaccine in the prevention of neonatal tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is a serious and often fatal condition that can occur when the umbilical cord is cut with a contaminated instrument or when the newborn's skin is exposed to tetanus spores in the environment.

The tetanus toxoid vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the tetanus toxin, which is the primary cause of the disease. When a person is vaccinated with the tetanus toxoid, their body is able to mount a rapid and effective immune response if they are exposed to the tetanus bacteria, preventing the development of the disease.

The other options are not effective in the prevention of neonatal tetanus:
A. Pentavalent I, II, and III vaccines are used to protect against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b, but they do not specifically target tetanus.
B. Anti-tetanus serum is used for the treatment of tetanus, not for prevention.
C. Measles vaccine is not effective against tetanus.

Therefore, the tetanus toxoid vaccine is the most appropriate choice for the prevention of neonatal tetanus.",D,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7330272,0.85373735,0.7887909

He smells of kerosene, has a loud grunt, respiratory rate of 96/minute, subcostal recession and bilaterally reduced breath sounds. Which of the following management steps must be avoided?
###Options:
A.  Cardiac positioning
B.  Insertion of venous cannula
C.  Administration of activated charcoal
D.  Gastric lavage

###Answer:","The correct answer is C. Administration of activated charcoal.

Rationale:
The presented scenario describes a case of suspected hydrocarbon (kerosene) ingestion in a child. The key clinical features include sudden breathlessness, kerosene odor, high respiratory rate, subcostal recession, and reduced breath sounds, which are indicative of hydrocarbon aspiration.

In the management of hydrocarbon ingestion, the following steps should be taken:

A. Cardiac positioning: Correct. This helps to maintain the airway and facilitate breathing.
B. Insertion of venous cannula: Correct. This allows for intravenous access and administration of fluids or medications if needed.
C. Administration of activated charcoal: Incorrect. Activated charcoal is not recommended in hydrocarbon ingestion as it does not bind effectively to hydrocarbons and may increase the risk of vomiting and subsequent aspiration.
D. Gastric lavage: Incorrect. Gastric lavage is also not recommended in hydrocarbon ingestion, as it can increase the risk of aspiration and further lung injury.

The key management priorities in hydrocarbon ingestion are to maintain the airway, provide supplemental oxygen, and monitor for respiratory distress and potential complications. Activated charcoal and gastric lavage should be avoided, as they can worsen the clinical condition.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.74974334,0.8534877,0.7982589

###Options:
A.  Hypoglycaemia
B.  Pulmonary oedema
C.  Severe anaemia
D.  Hypothermia

###Answer:","The correct answer is D. Hypothermia.

Rationale:
Severe malaria in children can present with various clinical manifestations, including:

A. Hypoglycemia: Severe malaria can lead to hypoglycemia due to increased glucose utilization by the parasite and impaired gluconeogenesis.

B. Pulmonary edema: Severe malaria can cause respiratory distress due to the development of pulmonary edema, a life-threatening complication.

C. Severe anemia: Severe malaria can result in severe anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells by the Plasmodium parasite.

D. Hypothermia is not a typical clinical manifestation of severe malaria in children. Instead, fever is a common symptom of severe malaria, as the body tries to fight the infection.

###Question: A 12-year-old boy weighing 28kg and resident in Nigeria presents with fever, poor feeding and passage of dark urine of 12 hours duration. He is severely pale, jaundiced with tender hepatomegaly of 6cm and splenomegaly of 8cm. His haematocrit reads 12% and the blood pressure is 75/60mmHg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Acute glomerulonephritis.
B.  Severe malaria.
C.  Septicaemia
D.  Viral hepatitis.

###Answer:","The most likely diagnosis in this case is B. Severe malaria.

Rationale:
The key features in this case are:
- Fever, poor feeding, and dark urine - suggestive of a severe acute illness
- Severe anemia (hematocrit of 12%) and jaundice - indicative of hemolysis
- Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly - common findings in severe malaria
- Hypotension - a sign of severe disease and possible shock

Given the patient's location in Nigeria, the most likely severe acute illness causing these symptoms is complicated/severe malaria. The presentation of fever, anemia, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and hypotension is highly characteristic of severe falciparum malaria.

The other options are less likely:
A. Acute glomerulonephritis typically presents with edema, hypertension, and proteinuria, which are not mentioned in this case.
C. Septicemia can cause similar symptoms, but the hepatosplenomegaly and severe anemia are more typical of malaria.
D. Viral hepatitis would not typically cause such severe anemia and hypotension.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is severe malaria, which requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent complications and mortality.",The most likely diagnosis in this case i,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.730094,0.8535955,0.7870292

###Question: A 10-year old female with chronic cough has a tuberculin test result of 10mm. What should the next important line of action be?

###Options:
A.  Request Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate.
B.  Request a Chest X-ray.
C.  Commence anti-tuberculous drugs.
D.  Request BCG vaccine administration.

###Answer:","The correct answer is B. Request a Chest X-ray.

Rationale:
A tuberculin skin test (TST) result of 10mm in a 10-year-old female with chronic cough is considered a positive result, indicating possible exposure to tuberculosis (TB) or latent TB infection. The next important step is to request a chest X-ray to assess for active TB disease.

A. Requesting an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is not the appropriate next step. ESR is a non-specific inflammatory marker that can be elevated in various conditions, including TB, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis.

B. Requesting a chest X-ray is the appropriate next step. A chest X-ray can help determine if the patient has active TB disease by identifying any abnormalities in the lungs, such as infiltrates, cavities, or lymphadenopathy.

C. Commencing anti-tuberculous drugs without further evaluation would be premature. The patient should first undergo a chest X-ray to confirm the presence of active TB disease before initiating treatment.

D. Requesting BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine administration is not the appropriate next step. The BCG vaccine is typically given to infants and young children to prevent severe forms of TB, but it does not play a role in the management of a positive tuberculin test in an older child.",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.74110496,0.8536578,0.7934095
