###Question: Which of the following conditions is characterized by an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, often resulting in a visibly enlarged neck, and is endemic in certain regions of Africa due to dietary iodine deficiency?
###Options:
A.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis
B.  Graves' disease
C.  Toxic multinodular goiter
D.  Simple (nontoxic) goiter
E.  Thyroid cancer

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Simple (nontoxic) goiter is a condition characterized by an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, often resulting in a visibly enlarged neck. It is often caused by dietary iodine deficiency, which is endemic in certain regions of Africa. The other options are not correct because Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition that can cause hypothyroidism, Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition that causes hyperthyroidism, toxic multinodular goiter is a condition that causes hyperthyroidism due to the presence of multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, and thyroid cancer is a type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland. None of these conditions are directly related to dietary iodine deficiency or are characterized by an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland due to iodine deficiency.

D.  Rift Valley fever
E.  Typhoid

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic to certain regions of West Africa. It is transmitted to humans through contact with infected rodents or their urine. The virus is shed in the urine of infected rodents, and humans can become infected through contact with contaminated food, water, or surfaces. Lassa fever is a significant public health concern in West Africa, where it is estimated to cause tens of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths each year. In contrast, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, and Rift Valley fever are also viral hemorrhagic fevers, but they are not transmitted through contact with infected rodents or their urine. Typhoid is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella Typhi, and it is not a viral hemorrhagic fever. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The V/Q scan is not appropriate in pregnancy because it involves the inhalation of radioactive material. This is not safe for the fetus. The other options are appropriate for the investigation of a suspected pulmonary embolus in pregnancy. The D-Dimer is a useful screening test but it is not diagnostic. The ECG can show signs of right heart strain. The CXR can show signs of pulmonary embolus such as the Westermark sign. The CTPA is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus but it involves radiation and should be used with caution in pregnancy. However, it is often necessary to diagnose or rule out a pulmonary embolus in pregnancy. The risks of a pulmonary embolus are higher in pregnancy and it is a leading cause of maternal mortality. Therefore, the V/Q scan is the only option that is not appropriate in the investigation of a suspected pulmonary embolus in pregnancy.  Note: The question is asking for the investigation that is NOT appropriate in the investigation of a suspected pulmonary embolus in pregnancy. The V/Q scan is the only option that is not appropriate.

B.  Northern blot
C.  Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test
D.  Southern blot
E.  Western blot

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. The Lassa virus is a member of the Old World arenaviruses. The most sensitive and specific test for detection of the Lassa virus genome is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. RT-PCR is a highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic test that can detect the viral genome in patient specimens. It is particularly useful for diagnosing viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Lassa fever, in which the viral load is typically high in the early stages of the disease. The other options are not as sensitive or specific for detecting the Lassa virus genome. Microarray analysis is a broad-based diagnostic test that can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously, but it is not as sensitive or specific as RT-PCR for detecting the Lassa virus genome. Northern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect RNA molecules, but it is not commonly used for diagnosing viral hemorrhagic fevers. Southern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect DNA molecules, but it is not commonly used for diagnosing viral hemorrhagic fevers. Western blot is a laboratory technique used to detect proteins, but it is not commonly used for diagnosing viral hemorrhagic fevers. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: In Kenya, the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) has a policy of only accepting voluntary blood donors. Commercial blood donation is not allowed as it is considered unethical and poses a risk to the donor's health. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. The other options are all acceptable blood donors in Kenya. A patient called donor is someone who donates blood in response to a call from a hospital or healthcare facility where they are a patient. A voluntary call responsive donor is someone who donates blood in response to a call from the NBTS or a hospital. A voluntary walk-in donor is someone who walks into a blood bank or donation center to donate blood voluntarily. Autologous donation is a type of donation where a person donates their own blood, which is then stored and reinfused into them at a later time. All of these types of donors are acceptable in Kenya.  Therefore, the correct answer is C. Commercial.  This is because commercial blood donation is not allowed in Kenya.  The other options are all acceptable blood donors in Kenya.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the brain that plays a crucial role in motor control. The degeneration of these neurons leads to a decrease in dopamine production, resulting in motor symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. Parkinson's disease is more prevalent in Africa, particularly in countries with a higher proportion of older adults. The other options are incorrect because they are characterized by different pathologies and symptoms. Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the basal ganglia and is characterized by chorea, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms. ALS is a motor neuron disease that affects the upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, causing demyelination and a wide range of neurological symptoms.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is a major public health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa. The symptoms of TB include chronic cough with sputum production, chest pain, weight loss, and fatigue. TB is transmitted through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing droplets that contain the bacteria. The bacteria can then be inhaled by another person, who becomes infected. TB can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the lungs. If left untreated, TB can lead to serious complications, including death. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Tuberculosis.  Pneumonia is an acute infection of the lungs, not a chronic infection like TB. Bronchiectasis is a condition in which the airways in the lungs become damaged, leading to chronic cough and sputum production. However, it is not caused by a bacterial infection. Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that can cause symptoms similar to TB, but it is not caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can cause symptoms such as cough, fever, and fatigue, but it is not caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Therefore, options A, B, D, and E are incorrect.

Schistosomiasis is caused by infection with the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma, which is acquired through contact with contaminated water. Onchocerciasis is caused by infection with the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected blackfly. Lymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with one of several species of filarial parasites, which are transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Loiasis is caused by infection with the parasitic worm Loa loa, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected deer fly. None of these diseases are characterized by the presence of a palpable worm beneath the skin. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

C.  In the baby friendly initiative, mothers with inverted nipples should still breastfeed exclusively
D.  In HIV infected babies, breastfeeding should stop at one year
E.  Exclusive breastfeeding reduces the incidence of asthma.

###Answer:","B
Rationale: According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) 2014, only 30% of children are exclusively breastfed. The KDHS 2014 is the most recent survey available. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a global program launched by WHO and UNICEF in 1991 to promote breastfeeding. The BFHI recommends that mothers with inverted nipples should still breastfeed exclusively. Exclusive breastfeeding reduces the risk of respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, and ear infections, but it does not reduce the incidence of asthma. In HIV-infected mothers, breastfeeding should be stopped at 12 months. The WHO recommends that HIV-infected mothers should not breastfeed their babies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

###Options:
A.  Rotavirus
B.  Salmonella
C.  Giardia lamblia
D.  Escherichia coli
E.  Shigella

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children under 5 years of age in Africa. It is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the fecal-oral route, and it can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in young children. In Africa, where access to clean water and sanitation may be limited, rotavirus infections are more common and can have serious consequences. Vaccination against rotavirus is available and has been shown to be effective in preventing severe diarrhea and hospitalizations due to rotavirus infections. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options, while also causes of diarrhea, are not the most common cause in children under 5 years of age in Africa. Salmonella and Shigella are more commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks, Giardia lamblia is a common cause of diarrhea in travelers to developing countries, and Escherichia coli can cause diarrhea but is not the most common cause in children under 5 years of age in Africa.

###Options:
A.  Cirrhosis
B.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
C.  Portal hypertension
D.  Ascites
E.  Hepatic encephalopathy

###Answer:","B
Rationale: 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in African populations. Chronic HBV infection can lead to cirrhosis, which is a known risk factor for HCC. However, the direct relationship between HBV infection and HCC is well established, and HCC is a common complication of untreated chronic HBV infection in African populations. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are not the most common complications of untreated chronic hepatitis B infection in African populations. Cirrhosis (option A) is a potential complication, but it is not as directly related to HBV infection as HCC. Portal hypertension (option C) and ascites (option D) are complications of cirrhosis, but they are not as specific to HBV infection as HCC. Hepatic encephalopathy (option E) is a complication of cirrhosis, but it is not as directly related to HBV infection as HCC. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the complications of untreated chronic hepatitis B infection, particularly in African populations, and to be able to identify the most common complication. The correct answer is based on the understanding of the relationship between HBV infection and HCC. 

This type of question is appropriate for assessing the test-taker's knowledge of the subject matter and their ability to apply that knowledge to specific scenarios. It requires the test-taker to think critically and make connections between different pieces of information. 

In terms of Bloom's Taxonomy, this question is at the level of Application, as it requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of the complications of untreated chronic hepatitis B infection to a specific scenario. It also requires the test-taker to analyze the information and make a judgment about the most common complication. 

This type of question is relevant to the topic of hepatitis B and liver disease, and it is appropriate for assessing the test-taker's knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. 

The question is clear and concise, and the options are specific and relevant to the topic. The correct answer is based on the understanding of the relationship between HBV infection and HCC, and the test-taker must be able to apply that knowledge to answer the question correctly.

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease, is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Dracunculus medinensis. The disease is endemic in certain parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The infection is acquired by drinking water containing copepods (water fleas) that are infected with the parasite. The parasite migrates through the body and eventually emerges through the skin, causing a blister or skin ulcer. The correct answer is B. Skin ulcer with worm emergence. The other options are not correct because joint pain and swelling (A) are not typical presentations of dracunculiasis, intermittent fever (C) is a nonspecific symptom that can be associated with many conditions, and muscle weakness (D) is not a common presentation of the disease. Option E is incorrect because B is a correct answer.  Note: The question is based on the topic of parasitology. The question is designed to test the knowledge of the common presentation of African endemic dracunculiasis. The correct answer is B. Skin ulcer with worm emergence.

###Question: A 25-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 2-week history of fever, headache, and joint pain. She also complains of a rash on her legs that started a few days ago. She has a history of traveling to a rural area in West Africa last month. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Dengue fever
B.  Malaria
C.  Lyme disease
D.  Yellow fever
E.  Zika virus

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, and joint pain, combined with a rash and a history of traveling to a rural area in West Africa, are highly suggestive of yellow fever. Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, and it is endemic in certain parts of West Africa. The patient's symptoms and travel history make it the most likely diagnosis. Dengue fever and Zika virus are also transmitted by mosquitoes, but they are more commonly associated with travel to Southeast Asia and the Americas, respectively. Malaria is also transmitted by mosquitoes, but it typically presents with symptoms such as chills, fever, and flu-like symptoms, and it is more commonly associated with travel to sub-Saharan Africa. Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks, not mosquitoes, and it is more commonly associated with travel to the northeastern United States and Europe. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Takayasu Aortoarteritis is a form of large vessel vasculitis that predominantly affects the aorta and its major branches. It is more common in young women and is a common cause of renal artery stenosis in children in Kenya. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a common cause of renal artery stenosis in children in the Western world. Fibrointimal hyperplasia is a common cause of renal artery stenosis in adults. Polyarteritis Nodosa is a form of medium vessel vasculitis that can affect the renal arteries but is less common than Takayasu Aortoarteritis in children.  Therefore, the correct answer is A. Takayasu Aortoarteritis.  The other options are incorrect.  B. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a common cause of renal artery stenosis in children in the Western world, not in Kenya.  C.

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Lassa fever and Ebola are both zoonotic diseases, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans. Lassa fever is caused by the Lassa virus, which is transmitted to humans through contact with the urine or feces of infected multimammate mice. Ebola is caused by the Ebola virus, which is transmitted to humans through contact with infected fruit bats or other animals. Therefore, the correct answer is E, rats, for Lassa fever, and B, fruit bats, for Ebola. However, since the question asks for the origin of both viruses, the correct answer is E, rats.  The other options are incorrect because humans (A) are the victims of these diseases, not their origin; primates (C) are not the origin of these diseases; and pigs (D) are not associated with either disease.  Fruit bats (B) are the origin of Ebola, but not Lassa fever.  Therefore, the best answer is E.  Note: The question is asking for the origin of both viruses, and the correct answer is E, rats.  The other options are incorrect because humans (A) are the victims of these diseases, not their origin; primates (C) are not the origin of these diseases; and pigs (D) are not associated with either disease.

###Question:  A 40-year-old African patient presents with painless, firm, enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical and axillary regions. Excisional lymph node biopsy reveals a diffuse proliferation of large, pleomorphic lymphoid cells expressing CD15 and CD30. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?
###Options:
A.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
B.  Follicular lymphoma
C.  Mantle cell lymphoma
D.  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
E.  Burkitt lymphoma

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The patient's presentation of painless, firm, enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical and axillary regions, along with the histopathological findings of a diffuse proliferation of large, pleomorphic lymphoid cells expressing CD15 and CD30, is most consistent with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that often presents with lymphadenopathy and can express CD15 and CD30, which are characteristic markers for this condition. The other options do not match the given clinical and histopathological findings as closely. DLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but it typically expresses B-cell markers such as CD20, not CD15 and CD30. Follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma are also types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they have distinct histopathological features and marker profiles that do not match the given description. Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with a more rapid onset of symptoms and expresses B-cell markers such as CD20, not CD15 and CD30.

###Question: Which of the following is a common cause of blindness in African populations?
###Options:
A.  Trachoma
B.  Onchocerciasis
C.  Vitamin A deficiency
D.  Glaucoma
E.  Cataracts

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Trachoma is a major cause of blindness in Africa. It is a bacterial infection of the eye caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, particularly in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that trachoma causes 8 million cases of blindness worldwide. In Africa, trachoma is a major public health problem, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited. The disease is often spread through poor hygiene and lack of access to clean water, making it a significant health issue in many African countries. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are not the most common cause of blindness in African populations. Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a significant cause of blindness in Africa, but it is not as common as trachoma. Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness, but it is not a common cause of blindness in African populations. Glaucoma and cataracts are common causes of blindness worldwide, but they are not as prevalent in African populations as trachoma. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the common causes of blindness in African populations and to be able to identify the most accurate answer based on that knowledge. It also requires the test-taker to be able to eliminate incorrect options and choose the correct answer. 

This type of question is appropriate for assessing the test-taker's knowledge and ability to apply that knowledge to a specific scenario. It is a good example of a question that requires critical thinking and analysis.

Rationale: The recommended Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in Nigeria is Artesunate-Amodiaquine, Artesunate-Mefloquine, and Artesunate-Lumefantrine. Artesunate-chloroquine is not recommended in Nigeria. Artesunate-chloroquine is recommended in some African countries but not in Nigeria. Artesunate-chloroquine is not recommended in Nigeria because of the high prevalence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Artesunate-Amodiaquine is recommended in Nigeria because it is effective against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Artesunate-Mefloquine is also recommended in Nigeria because it is effective against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Artesunate-Lumefantrine is also recommended in Nigeria because it is effective against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Artesunate-Pyronaridin is not recommended in Nigeria because it is not effective against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum.

###Options:
A.  Dengue fever
B.  Malaria
C.  Rheumatoid arthritis
D.  Tuberculosis
E.  Buruli ulcer

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fever, joint pain, and a papular rash, combined with her recent travel to a rural area in Uganda, are highly suggestive of dengue fever. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness that is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including Uganda. The symptoms of dengue fever can include fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, and a characteristic rash. The patient's recent travel history and symptoms make dengue fever the most likely diagnosis. The other options are less likely: malaria is a mosquito-borne illness that can cause fever and joint pain, but it is not typically associated with a papular rash; rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that can cause joint pain, but it is not typically associated with a rash or travel history; tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause fever and joint pain, but it is not typically associated with a rash or travel history to Uganda; and Buruli ulcer is a bacterial infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with fever, joint pain, or a papular rash. 

Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and travel history. The correct answer requires an understanding of the clinical presentation of dengue fever and its epidemiology.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The first-line treatment for cholera is oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is a simple and effective way to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. ORS is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the first-line treatment for cholera. Antibiotics such as azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used in addition to ORS to treat cholera, but they are not the first-line treatment. In Nigeria, the first-line treatment for cholera is ORS, as recommended by the WHO and the Nigerian Ministry of Health. 

Note: The treatment of cholera may vary depending on the country and the specific guidelines of the local health authorities. However, in general, ORS is the first-line treatment for cholera.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The operative management of major omphalocele in Nigeria is usually done with the use of a prosthetic silo. This is because the prosthetic silo is a readily available and affordable option in Nigeria. It is also a good option for the initial management of the omphalocele, allowing for gradual return of the contents into the abdominal cavity. The prosthetic silo is usually made of a silastic or silastic-like material and is placed in the abdominal cavity to gently push the contents of the omphalocele back into the abdominal cavity. This approach is preferred in Nigeria due to the limited availability of other materials such as teflon/gortex mesh, prolene mesh, and silastic sheet. The use of a normal saline bag is not a preferred option for the operative management of major omphalocele.

Rationale: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the rectum. The rectum is the part of the large intestine that stores stool until it is eliminated from the body. It is located in the pelvis, just above the anus. The rectum is a common site for colorectal cancer, which is a type of cancer that begins in the colon or rectum. In Nigeria, the rectum is the most common site for colorectal cancer, accounting for the majority of cases. Therefore, the statement that the commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the anus is false.

###Question: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the recto-sigmoid.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the recto-sigmoid. This is because the majority of colorectal cancers in Nigeria are adenocarcinomas, which are more common in the recto-sigmoid region. The recto-sigmoid region is also the most common site of colorectal cancer in other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe. Therefore, the statement is true.

###Options:
A.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis
B.  Mycobacterium avium complex
C.  Mycobacterium leprae
D.  Mycobacterium ulcerans
E.  Mycobacterium bovis

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is a significant public health problem in many developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. The bacterium primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes. The disease is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and disfigurement. In Africa, Mycobacterium leprae is the primary etiological agent of leprosy, and it is responsible for the high prevalence of the disease in the region. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they are not the primary etiological agents of leprosy in African countries with high prevalence. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex is associated with lung disease, Mycobacterium ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer, and Mycobacterium bovis causes tuberculosis in animals and can be transmitted to humans.

E.  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of acute liver failure in Africa. HBV infection is endemic in many African countries, and it is estimated that up to 8% of the population in some areas may be infected. HBV infection can cause acute liver failure, particularly in individuals who are co-infected with HIV or have underlying liver disease. In contrast, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is less common in Africa, and Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that is not typically associated with acute liver failure in Africa. Alcohol-induced liver injury and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are also less common causes of acute liver failure in Africa. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

###Answer:","B
Rationale: In African populations, the most common complication of untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus is diabetic retinopathy. This is due to the high prevalence of diabetes in these populations, which can lead to a higher incidence of complications such as retinopathy. Peripheral neuropathy is also a common complication, but it is not as prevalent as retinopathy in African populations. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is more commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complication of obesity and insulin resistance, but not directly related to diabetes. Cushing's syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder that is not directly related to diabetes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Retinopathy.

###Options:
A.  Hemoptysis
B.  Renal failure
C.  Retrosternal chest pain
D.  Petechial rash
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. It is caused by the Lassa virus, which is transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated with the urine or feces of infected rodents. The symptoms of Lassa fever can range from mild to severe and include fever, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, and swelling of the face and neck. A common manifestation of Lassa fever is a petechial rash, which is a rash characterized by small, pinpoint spots on the skin. This rash is a result of bleeding under the skin and is a sign of the virus's ability to cause hemorrhaging. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because while they may be symptoms of other viral hemorrhagic fevers, they are not common manifestations of Lassa fever. Option E is incorrect because option D is a correct answer.  Note: The question is about Lassa fever, but the options include symptoms that are common to other viral hemorrhagic fevers as well. This is because Lassa fever is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever, and the symptoms listed in the options are common to this group of diseases. The correct answer is the one that is most specific to Lassa fever. In this case, the correct answer is option D, petechial rash. This is because Lassa fever is known to cause a petechial rash, which is a characteristic symptom of the disease.

###Question:  A 40-year-old African patient presents with a painful, swollen knee that is warm to the touch. Synovial fluid analysis reveals an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Septic arthritis
D.  Gout
E.  Pseudogout

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The patient's presentation of a painful, swollen knee that is warm to the touch, along with an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance in the synovial fluid analysis, is highly suggestive of septic arthritis. This condition is characterized by an infection within the joint space, which can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with this diagnosis, making it the most likely choice. The other options do not match the patient's presentation as closely. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that typically presents with joint pain and stiffness, but not typically with an elevated white blood cell count. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that can cause joint pain and swelling, but it is not typically associated with a high white blood cell count in the synovial fluid. Gout and pseudogout are both types of crystal-induced arthritis, but they do not typically present with a high white blood cell count in the synovial fluid. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation and lab results.

###Options:
A.  Glaucoma
B.  Cataracts
C.  Diabetic retinopathy
D.  Trachoma
E.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Trachoma is a leading cause of blindness in African adults. It is a bacterial infection of the eye caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a major public health problem in many developing countries, particularly in Africa. Trachoma is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, and it is estimated that it causes 1.9 million cases of blindness annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a global initiative to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020. The main risk factors for trachoma include poor sanitation, lack of access to clean water, and poor living conditions. Trachoma is typically spread through direct contact with an infected person's eye discharge, and it can also be spread through contaminated water or food. The symptoms of trachoma include redness, itching, and discharge from the eye, and if left untreated, it can lead to blindness. Treatment for trachoma typically involves antibiotics, and prevention measures include improving access to clean water and sanitation, promoting good hygiene practices, and providing regular eye exams to detect the disease early. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Trachoma.  Glaucoma (A) is a leading cause of blindness in African Americans, but it is not the leading cause of blindness in African adults. Cataracts (B) are a leading cause of blindness worldwide, but they are not the leading cause of blindness in African adults. Diabetic retinopathy (C) is a leading cause of blindness in people with diabetes, but it is not the leading cause of blindness in African adults. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (E) is a leading cause of blindness in older adults, but it is not the leading cause of blindness in African adults.  Therefore, the correct answer is D. Trachoma.  Glaucoma (A) is a leading cause of blindness in African Americans, but it is not the leading cause of blindness in African adults. Cataracts (B) are a leading cause of blindness worldwide, but they are not the leading cause of blindness in African adults.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The symptoms described in the question are characteristic of schizophrenia, which is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. The symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking and behavior, and negative symptoms such as social withdrawal. In many African cultures, spiritual beliefs play a significant role in illness perceptions, and schizophrenia is often attributed to spiritual or supernatural causes. Therefore, a diagnosis of schizophrenia is the most likely in this scenario. The other options are not supported by the symptoms described. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities, bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings between mania and depression, PTSD is characterized by flashbacks and avoidance of triggers, and OCD is characterized by recurring, intrusive thoughts and compulsions to perform specific rituals. None of these diagnoses match the symptoms described in the question.  Note: The question is designed to test the ability to apply knowledge of psychiatric diagnoses to a specific cultural context.

D.  Tree nuts
E.  Fish

###Answer:","C
Rationale: In Africa, peanuts are a common allergen responsible for food allergies in children. This is due to the high consumption of peanuts in the region. Peanuts are a staple food in many African countries, and their high consumption can lead to an increased risk of peanut allergy. In fact, studies have shown that peanut allergy is more prevalent in African children compared to children in other parts of the world. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options, eggs, wheat, tree nuts, and fish, are also common allergens, but they are not as commonly associated with food allergies in African children as peanuts are. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the common allergens responsible for food allergies in different populations and to be able to apply this knowledge to a specific scenario. It also requires the test-taker to be able to analyze the options and choose the one that is most relevant to the question being asked. 

In terms of reasoning skill, this question requires the test-taker to use inductive reasoning, as they need to make a generalization based on specific information. The test-taker needs to use their knowledge of the common allergens and their prevalence in different populations to make an educated guess about which allergen is most likely responsible for food allergies in African children. 

This type of question is relevant to the topic of food allergies and is appropriate for a test or assessment of knowledge in this area. It requires the test-taker to think critically and apply their knowledge in a practical way, making it a useful tool for evaluating their understanding of the subject.

###Question: Which of the following is the most common type of breast cancer in Africa?
###Options:
A.  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
B.  Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
C.  Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)
D.  Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)
E.  Paget's disease of the breast

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer in Africa. IDC accounts for approximately 70-80% of all breast cancer cases in Africa. This is in contrast to the Western world where IDC accounts for approximately 50-60% of all breast cancer cases. The higher incidence of IDC in Africa is thought to be due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. IDC is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk ducts of the breast and then invades the surrounding breast tissue. It is a more aggressive form of breast cancer and is often diagnosed at a later stage, which can make treatment more challenging. Early detection and diagnosis are critical in improving outcomes for women with IDC in Africa.  IDC is the most common type of breast cancer in Africa because of the genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that are prevalent in the region. These factors include a higher prevalence of genetic mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, which increase the risk of breast cancer. Additionally, environmental factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals and radiation, may also contribute to the development of IDC. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables, may also play a role in the development of IDC.  In conclusion, IDC is the most common type of breast cancer in Africa due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

###Options:
A.  Trypanosomiasis (Chagas diseases)
B.  Alcohol abuse
C.  Iron deficiency
D.  Genetic mutations
E.  Viral infections

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Trypanosomiasis, also known as Chagas disease, is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is a common cause of cardiomyopathy in parts of Africa and South America. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected triatomine bug. The parasite can cause inflammation and damage to the heart muscle, leading to cardiomyopathy. In Africa, Chagas disease is a significant public health problem, particularly in rural areas where the triatomine bug is common. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. The other options are not correct because while they can cause cardiomyopathy, they are not as common causes in parts of Africa as Trypanosomiasis.  Alcohol abuse (option B) is a common cause of cardiomyopathy worldwide, but it is not as prevalent in Africa as Trypanosomiasis. Iron deficiency (option C) can cause cardiomyopathy, but it is not a common cause in Africa. Genetic mutations (option D) can cause cardiomyopathy, but they are not as common as Trypanosomiasis in Africa. Viral infections (option E) can cause cardiomyopathy, but they are not as common as Trypanosomiasis in Africa.  Therefore, option A is the correct answer.  The other options are not correct because while they can cause cardiomyopathy, they are not as common causes in parts of Africa as Trypanosomiasis.  Alcohol abuse (option B) is a common cause of cardiomyopathy worldwide, but it is not as prevalent in Africa as Trypanosomiasis.

A.  Inhaled corticosteroids
B.  Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs)
C.  Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs)
D.  Leukotriene receptor antagonists
E.  Theophylline

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The patient's symptoms and pulmonary function test results are consistent with an acute exacerbation of asthma. Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) are the most appropriate initial treatment for acute asthma exacerbations because they provide rapid relief of bronchospasm and are effective in improving lung function. Inhaled corticosteroids (A) are used for long-term control of asthma, LABAs (B) are used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for long-term control, and leukotriene receptor antagonists (D) are used as add-on therapy for patients who remain symptomatic despite inhaled corticosteroids. Theophylline (E) is not a first-line treatment for acute asthma exacerbations.  (Choice C is correct.) (F) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common comorbidity in patients with asthma, and treatment of GERD may improve asthma symptoms.

###Question: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the ascending colon.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the rectum. The rectum is the part of the large intestine that stores stool until it is eliminated from the body. The rectum is located in the pelvis, and it is the last part of the large intestine before the anus. The rectum is a common site for colorectal cancer, which is a type of cancer that begins in the colon or rectum. In Nigeria, the rectum is the most common site for colorectal cancer, not the ascending colon. The ascending colon is the part of the large intestine that is located on the right side of the abdomen, and it is less common for colorectal cancer to occur in this area. Therefore, the correct answer is B. False.

E.  Coxiella burnetii

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Rickettsia africae is the causative agent of African tick-bite fever, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. The disease is characterized by fever, headache, and a characteristic rash. Rickettsia africae is a member of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae, which also includes Rickettsia rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The other options are not correct because Rickettsia prowazekii causes epidemic typhus, Rickettsia typhi causes murine typhus, and Coxiella burnetii causes Q fever.  Therefore, the correct answer is C. Rickettsia africae.  This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the etiology of African tick-bite fever and the characteristics of the different rickettsial diseases.  It also requires the test-taker to be able to eliminate incorrect options based on their knowledge of the subject.  This type of question is appropriate for assessing the test-taker's ability to apply their knowledge of the subject to a specific scenario.  It is also a good example of a question that requires the test-taker to think critically and make an informed decision based on the information provided.  Therefore, it is a good question for assessing the test-taker's ability to think critically and make informed decisions.  This type of question is also a good example of a question that requires the test-taker to have a deep understanding of the subject matter, as they need to be able to distinguish between different rickettsial diseases and their etiological agents.  Therefore, it is a good question for assessing the test-taker's ability to demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter.  This type of question is also a good example of a question that requires the test-taker to have a broad knowledge of the subject matter, as they need to be able to consider multiple options and eliminate incorrect ones.

###Options:
A.  Escherichia coli
B.  Klebsiella
C.  Staph aureus
D.  Listeria monocytogenes
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The most common cause of neonatal sepsis in hospitals in Zambia is Escherichia coli. This is because E. coli is a common cause of neonatal sepsis in many parts of the world, including Africa. It is often acquired through vertical transmission from the mother during delivery, and can also be acquired through horizontal transmission from healthcare workers or contaminated equipment. In Zambia, E. coli is likely to be the most common cause of neonatal sepsis due to its prevalence in the community and the lack of access to clean water and sanitation, which can contribute to the spread of the bacteria. 

Note: The other options are not the most common cause of neonatal sepsis in hospitals in Zambia. Klebsiella and Staph aureus can cause neonatal sepsis, but they are less common than E. coli. Listeria monocytogenes is a rare cause of neonatal sepsis, and is typically associated with outbreaks or specific risk factors such as maternal consumption of contaminated food.  None of the above is incorrect because E. coli is indeed a common cause of neonatal sepsis in hospitals in Zambia.  End of Rationale

C.  Recommend traditional herbal remedies
D.  Refer the patient to a pulmonologist
E.  Conduct a physical examination and obtain further history

###Answer:","E
Rationale: The patient's symptoms of persistent cough, fever, and fatigue are suggestive of tuberculosis (TB), which is a common condition in Africa. The most appropriate next step in the clinical management would be to conduct a physical examination and obtain further history to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. This would involve asking questions about the patient's occupation, travel history, and exposure to TB, as well as performing a physical examination to look for signs of TB, such as weight loss and lymphadenopathy. Ordering a chest X-ray (option B) may be helpful in diagnosing TB, but it is not the most appropriate next step without first conducting a physical examination and obtaining further history. Prescribing antibiotics immediately (option A) is not appropriate without a confirmed diagnosis of a bacterial infection. Recommending traditional herbal remedies (option C) is not a recommended course of action for a patient with symptoms suggestive of TB. Referring the patient to a pulmonologist (option D) may be necessary if the diagnosis is confirmed, but it is not the most appropriate next step without first conducting a physical examination and obtaining further history. 

Note: This question requires the test-taker to use their knowledge of clinical management and diagnostic reasoning to determine the most appropriate next step in the care of a patient with symptoms suggestive of TB.

###Question: Which of the following is a common presentation of African tick-bite fever?
###Options:
A.  Rash resembling measles
B.  Hemolytic anemia
C.  Neurological symptoms
D.  Acute kidney injury
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","A
Rationale: African tick-bite fever is caused by Rickettsia africae, transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. The disease typically presents with a rash that resembles measles, fever, headache, and myalgia. The rash is usually the first symptom to appear, and it can be accompanied by a characteristic eschar at the site of the tick bite. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not typical presentations of African tick-bite fever. Option E is also incorrect because option A is a correct answer.  African tick-bite fever is a tick-borne disease that is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by Rickettsia africae, a bacterium that is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The disease typically presents with a rash that resembles measles, fever, headache, and myalgia. The rash is usually the first symptom to appear, and it can be accompanied by a characteristic eschar at the site of the tick bite. The eschar is a small, painless, and usually circular lesion that forms at the site of the tick bite. It is a key diagnostic feature of African tick-bite fever. The disease is usually self-limiting and resolves on its own within a few days. However, it can be treated with antibiotics to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms. In severe cases, African tick-bite fever can lead to complications such as pneumonia, meningitis, and encephalitis. Therefore, prompt medical attention is essential to prevent these complications. In conclusion, African tick-bite fever is a tick-borne disease that is caused by Rickettsia africae, transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. It typically presents with a rash that resembles measles, fever, headache, and myalgia, and can be treated with antibiotics to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms.  The correct answer is A. Rash resembling measles.  The rationale is that African tick-bite fever is a tick-borne disease that is caused by Rickettsia africae, transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. It typically presents with a rash that resembles measles, fever, headache, and myalgia. The rash is usually the first symptom to appear, and it can be accompanied by a characteristic eschar at the site of the tick bite. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

###Question: A 45-year-old African patient presents with a history of chronic knee pain, swelling, and instability, worse with physical activity. Physical examination reveals joint laxity and a positive Lachman test. Imaging reveals a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option?
###Options:
A.  Conservative management with physical therapy
B.  Open ACL repair
C.  Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction
D.  Knee brace immobilization
E.  Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The patient in this scenario has a torn ACL, which is a common injury in young, active individuals. The ACL is a critical stabilizer of the knee joint, and its injury can lead to further joint damage and degenerative changes if left untreated. Conservative management with physical therapy (Option A) may be appropriate for some patients with ACL injuries, but it is not the most appropriate treatment option for this patient, who is young and active and has a significant knee instability. Open ACL repair (Option B) is a more invasive procedure that is rarely used today, as it has a higher risk of complications and a longer recovery time compared to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Knee brace immobilization (Option D) may provide some stability and support, but it does not address the underlying injury and is not a definitive treatment. Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint (Option E) may provide temporary pain relief, but it does not address the underlying injury and may have potential side effects. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction (Option C) is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient, as it is a minimally invasive procedure that can restore knee stability and function, allowing the patient to return to their normal activities. This procedure is particularly suitable for young, active individuals who require a high level of knee function. Note: The question is designed to test the ability to apply knowledge of knee anatomy and function, as well as the ability to evaluate the appropriateness of different treatment options for a specific patient scenario. The correct answer requires an understanding of the importance of knee stability and the role of the ACL in maintaining joint function.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated that over 80% of the world's schistosomiasis cases occur in Africa. The disease is prevalent in 55 countries in Africa, and it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many of these countries. The high prevalence of schistosomiasis in Africa is due to a combination of factors, including the presence of suitable snail intermediate hosts, the presence of suitable definitive hosts (humans), and the lack of effective control measures in many areas. Therefore, the statement that >80% of the people globally affected by schistosomiasis live in Africa is true.

###Options:
A.  Bone densitometry
B.  Ultrasound
C.  MRI
D.  Nuclear medicine
E.  PET

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Ultrasound is a widely used imaging modality in Africa for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver cirrhosis and related complications. It is non-invasive, cost-effective, and widely available in many African countries. Ultrasound can help identify liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and other complications such as ascites, splenomegaly, and varices. It is also useful for monitoring the progression of liver disease and the response to treatment. In contrast, the other options are not as commonly used for this purpose in Africa due to limited availability, high cost, or lack of expertise. Bone densitometry is used to assess osteoporosis, MRI is used for a wide range of applications but not commonly for liver cirrhosis, nuclear medicine is used for specific applications such as cancer staging and PET is used for cancer staging and monitoring.  Therefore, the correct answer is B. Ultrasound.

###Options:
A.  Congenital heart disease
B.  Cardiomyopathy
C.  Coronary artery disease
D.  Rheumatic heart disease
E.  Hypertensive heart disease

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The most common cause of heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa is rheumatic heart disease. This is due to the high prevalence of rheumatic fever in this region, which can lead to rheumatic heart disease and subsequent heart failure. Rheumatic heart disease is a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and it is estimated that it accounts for a large proportion of heart failure cases in the region. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are not the most common cause of heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa. Congenital heart disease (option A) is a rare cause of heart failure in adults. Cardiomyopathy (option B) is a common cause of heart failure worldwide, but it is not the most common cause in sub-Saharan Africa. Coronary artery disease (option C) is a common cause of heart failure in developed countries, but it is not as common in sub-Saharan Africa. Hypertensive heart disease (option E) is a common cause of heart failure, but it is not the most common cause in sub-Saharan Africa. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the epidemiology of heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa and to be able to identify the most common cause. It also requires the test-taker to be able to eliminate incorrect options based on their knowledge of the subject.

Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?
###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Avascular necrosis
D.  Septic arthritis
E.  Gout

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The patient's presentation of progressive hip pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, along with imaging findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, is most consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a degenerative joint disease that typically affects weight-bearing joints, such as the hips, and is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and underlying bone. The elevated serum uric acid levels in this patient are not indicative of gout, as gout is typically associated with acute, episodic attacks of joint inflammation and is more common in men. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and pain in the joints, but it typically affects multiple joints symmetrically and is not typically associated with elevated uric acid levels. Avascular necrosis is a condition in which the blood supply to the bone is disrupted, leading to bone death, and is not typically associated with the imaging findings described. Septic arthritis is an infection of the joint, which would be indicated by laboratory findings of elevated white blood cell count and joint fluid analysis showing pus. In this case, the patient's presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with osteoarthritis.

E.  Fear of emasculation associated with orchidectomy, causing reluctance to undergo surgical intervention

###Answer:","A. Belief in traditional healers for the treatment of testicular masses, delaying access to standard medical care
Rationale: In some African communities, there is a cultural belief in traditional healers for the treatment of testicular masses. This belief may lead to a delay in seeking standard medical care, which can hinder the early detection and treatment of testicular cancer. Healthcare providers can address this challenge by educating patients and their families about the importance of seeking medical care from qualified healthcare professionals, and by working with traditional healers to promote a collaborative approach to healthcare. This may involve training traditional healers to recognize the signs and symptoms of testicular cancer and to refer patients to medical facilities for further evaluation and treatment. By addressing this cultural belief, healthcare providers can improve access to timely and effective care for patients with testicular cancer.

E.  Diabetes

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The most common cause of chronic liver disease in Africa is viral hepatitis B. This is due to the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the region, which is often transmitted vertically from mother to child or through horizontal transmission in childhood. The high prevalence of HBV infection in Africa contributes to the development of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, option B is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are not the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Africa. Alcoholic liver disease (option A) is more common in regions with high alcohol consumption, such as Europe and North America. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (option C) is also more common in regions with high obesity rates, such as North America. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (option D) is a complication of chronic liver disease, but it is not the most common cause. Diabetes (option E) is not directly related to chronic liver disease. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the epidemiology of liver disease in Africa and to be able to identify the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the region.

Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative bacterium that is transmitted through the fecal-oral route and can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In Africa, Shigella flexneri is often the primary cause of enteric fever, and it is estimated that it accounts for up to 50% of all cases of enteric fever in some regions. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are incorrect because Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi is the primary cause of typhoid fever worldwide, but not in Africa; Vibrio cholerae is the cause of cholera, not typhoid fever; Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a cause of hemorrhagic colitis, not typhoid fever; and Yersinia pestis is the cause of plague, not typhoid fever. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the epidemiology of enteric fever in Africa and to be able to distinguish between different bacterial pathogens that can cause similar symptoms. It also requires the test-taker to be able to analyze the options and choose the correct answer based on their knowledge of the subject. 

This type of question is appropriate for a graduate-level exam in infectious diseases or epidemiology, as it requires a high level of knowledge and critical thinking skills. 

In terms of Bloom's Taxonomy, this question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of the subject to a specific scenario, which is a higher level of thinking. It also requires the test-taker to analyze the options and choose the correct answer, which is a critical thinking skill. 

Therefore, this question is a good example of a question that requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge and critical thinking skills to arrive at the correct answer. 

Note: The question is designed to be self-contained, meaning that the test-taker does not need to refer to any external resources or previous questions to answer it.

###Options:
A.  Breast cancer
B.  Cervical cancer
C.  Ovarian cancer
D.  Endometrial cancer
E.  Prostrate Cancer

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in Africa. This is due to the high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is a major risk factor for cervical cancer. In many African countries, there is limited access to cervical cancer screening and treatment, which contributes to the high incidence of this disease. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in Africa, accounting for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths in the region. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because while breast cancer is a common cancer among women in Africa, it is not the most common. Ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer are less common in Africa, and prostrate cancer is more common among men.  Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

###Options:
A.  Scurvy
B.  Kwashiorkor
C.  Pellagra
D.  Beriberi
E.  Vitiligo

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Pellagra is a disease caused by a lack of the vitamin niacin (vitamin B3). It is characterized by the three D's: diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. Pellagra is common in Africa and is often associated with a diet that is low in niacin and tryptophan, an amino acid that the body can convert into niacin. The dermatitis associated with pellagra can manifest as symmetric pigmented patches on the skin. Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C, and is characterized by fatigue, malaise, and bleeding gums. Kwashiorkor is a form of malnutrition that is caused by a lack of protein in the diet, and is characterized by edema, muscle wasting, and a variety of other symptoms. Beriberi is a disease caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1), and is characterized by muscle weakness, nerve damage, and heart failure. Vitiligo is a condition in which the skin loses its pigment, resulting in white patches on the skin. It is not caused by a nutritional deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pellagra.

###Question:  A 35-year-old African patient presents with acute knee pain and swelling following a twisting injury. Physical examination reveals a positive anterior drawer test. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury
B.  Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury
C.  Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
D.  Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury
E.  Meniscus tear

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The anterior drawer test is a physical examination maneuver used to assess the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). A positive anterior drawer test indicates that the tibia is able to be pulled forward in relation to the femur, suggesting an ACL injury. The ACL is a key stabilizer of the knee joint, and its injury is a common consequence of twisting injuries, such as the one described in the scenario. While MCL, LCL, PCL, and meniscus injuries can also occur following a twisting injury, the positive anterior drawer test is most indicative of an ACL injury. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.  The other options are incorrect because the anterior drawer test is not typically used to assess MCL, LCL, PCL, or meniscus injuries.  MCL injuries are often associated with valgus stress tests, LCL injuries with varus stress tests, PCL injuries with posterior drawer tests, and meniscus tears with McMurray tests.  Therefore, options A, B, D, and E are incorrect.  The patient's African ethnicity is not relevant to the diagnosis, and the patient's age and sex are not particularly relevant to the diagnosis, although ACL injuries are more common in younger, active individuals.  Therefore, the patient's demographic information is not particularly useful in this case.  The patient's symptoms of acute knee pain and swelling following a twisting injury are consistent with an ACL injury, but the positive anterior drawer test is the most specific and sensitive finding in this case.  Therefore, the patient's symptoms are not particularly useful in this case.  The patient's physical examination findings of a positive anterior drawer test are the most useful information in this case.  Therefore, the patient's physical examination findings are the most relevant information in this case.  The patient's physical examination findings of a positive anterior drawer test are the most useful information in this case.  Therefore, the patient's physical examination findings are the most relevant information in this case.

E.  All of the above

###Answer:","A
Rationale: In the neurological stage of African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), patients often present with confusion, sleep disturbances, and other neurological symptoms. This stage is characterized by the invasion of the central nervous system by the parasite, leading to a range of symptoms including confusion, disorientation, and sleep disturbances. The other options are not specific presentations of the neurological stage of African trypanosomiasis. Fever and chills are more commonly associated with the early stages of the disease, while jaundice and hepatomegaly are not typical presentations of the disease. Cutaneous ulcers are a feature of Chagas disease, not African trypanosomiasis. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

B.  Large, painless skin ulcers
C.  Papular rash
D.  Severe itching
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The correct answer is B.  Large, painless skin ulcers.  Buruli ulcer is a chronic, necrotizing infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The disease is characterized by the development of large, painless skin ulcers, which can be disfiguring and debilitating. The ulcers typically begin as a painless nodule or papule that gradually enlarges and deepens, eventually forming a large, painless ulcer. The ulcers can be quite large, sometimes covering an area of several square centimeters, and can be disfiguring and debilitating. The disease is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, and is often associated with aquatic environments. The correct answer is B.  Large, painless skin ulcers. The other options are incorrect because Buruli ulcer is typically painless, not painful (A), and does not typically present with a papular rash (C) or severe itching (D). Option E is also incorrect because B is a correct answer.  Note: The question is based on the topic of Buruli ulcer, which is a type of mycobacterial infection.

###Options:
A.  Chronic alcohol consumption
B.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
C.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
D.  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
E.  Aflatoxin exposure

###Answer:","E
Rationale: In Africa, the main risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is aflatoxin exposure. Aflatoxins are mycotoxins produced by certain species of Aspergillus, which can contaminate food, particularly grains and nuts. Chronic exposure to aflatoxins has been linked to an increased risk of HCC, particularly in regions where the diet is high in aflatoxin-contaminated foods. In contrast, chronic alcohol consumption (A) is a major risk factor for HCC in Western countries, but it is less common in Africa. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (B) is a major risk factor for HCC worldwide, but it is not as prevalent in Africa as it is in Asia. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (D) is also a risk factor for HCC, but it is less common in Africa than in Western countries. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (C) is a risk factor for HCC, but it is not as prevalent in Africa as it is in Western countries. Therefore, the correct answer is E, aflatoxin exposure.

B.  Family history of sickle cell disease
C.  Vitamin D deficiency
D.  Hemoglobin AS genotype
E.  Hemoglobin AC genotype

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Vitamin D deficiency is not a risk factor for sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the HBB gene that codes for the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. The risk of sickle cell disease is determined by the genotype of the individual, with the hemoglobin AS genotype being a carrier state and the hemoglobin SS genotype being the disease-causing genotype. Malaria, family history of sickle cell disease, hemoglobin AS genotype, and hemoglobin AC genotype are all risk factors for sickle cell disease in Nigeria. Vitamin D deficiency, on the other hand, is a risk factor for other health conditions, such as osteoporosis and rickets, but not for sickle cell disease. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  Note: The question is about Nigeria, where sickle cell disease is common due to the high prevalence of the sickle cell gene. The question is testing the knowledge of the risk factors for sickle cell disease in this specific context.

###Question: Common causes of neonatal jaundice in Nigeria include
###Options:
A.  Rh isoimmunization
B.  Septicemia
C.  Prematurity
D.  ABO incompatibility
E.  Hypothyroidism

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The most common cause of neonatal jaundice in Nigeria is prematurity. This is because prematurity is a common condition in Nigeria due to factors such as poor maternal nutrition, inadequate antenatal care, and high rates of maternal and infant infections. Premature infants are at a higher risk of developing jaundice due to their immature liver function and increased bilirubin production. Other causes of neonatal jaundice, such as Rh isoimmunization, ABO incompatibility, and hypothyroidism, are less common in Nigeria. Septicemia is a possible cause of jaundice in neonates, but it is not a common cause in Nigeria. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  The other options are not the most common causes of neonatal jaundice in Nigeria. Rh isoimmunization is a common cause of jaundice in neonates in countries with a high prevalence of Rh-negative mothers, but it is less common in Nigeria. ABO incompatibility is a rare cause of jaundice in neonates in Nigeria. Hypothyroidism is a rare cause of jaundice in neonates in Nigeria. Septicemia is a possible cause of jaundice in neonates, but it is not a common cause in Nigeria. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  The other options are not the most common causes of neonatal jaundice in Nigeria. Rh isoimmunization is a common cause of jaundice in neonates in countries with a high prevalence of Rh-negative mothers, but it is less common in Nigeria.

E.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The African meningitis belt is a region in sub-Saharan Africa where meningitis is common. The most common cause of meningitis in this region is Neisseria meningitidis. This is due to the dry season, which leads to close living conditions and poor hygiene, making it easier for the bacteria to spread. Vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis is recommended for travelers to this region. The other options are not as commonly associated with meningitis in this region. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is more commonly associated with meningitis in children in developed countries. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of meningitis worldwide, but it is not as prevalent in the African meningitis belt as Neisseria meningitidis. Listeria monocytogenes is more commonly associated with meningitis in pregnant women, newborns, and people with weakened immune systems. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a cause of tuberculous meningitis, which is a different type of meningitis.  Therefore, the correct answer is A. Neisseria meningitidis.  This is because Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of meningitis in the African meningitis belt.  The other options are not as commonly associated with meningitis in this region.  Therefore, the correct answer is A. Neisseria meningitidis.  This is because Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of meningitis in the African meningitis belt.

###Options:
A.  Loss of eyebrows
B.  Painless skin lesions
C.  Enlarged lymph nodes
D.  Red, swollen eyes
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes. The disease is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and disfigurement. In African endemic leprosy, the most common presentation is painless skin lesions. These lesions are usually red or pink in color and may be flat or raised. They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most commonly found on the face, arms, and legs. In some cases, the lesions may be accompanied by nerve damage, which can cause numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected area. The lesions are painless because the nerve endings in the skin are damaged, which is why they are often referred to as ""painless"" lesions. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  The other options are not correct because loss of eyebrows (A) is not a common presentation of African endemic leprosy, enlarged lymph nodes (C) are not a typical feature of the disease, and red, swollen eyes (D) are not a common presentation of African endemic leprosy.  Option E is incorrect because option B is a correct answer.  Therefore, the correct answer is B.  Painless skin lesions.  This is a common presentation of African endemic leprosy.  The other options are not correct.  Therefore, the correct answer is B.  Painless skin lesions.  This is a common presentation of African endemic leprosy.  The other options are not correct.  Therefore, the correct answer is B.  Painless skin lesions.  This is a common presentation of African endemic leprosy.  The other options are not correct.  Therefore, the correct answer is B.

###Options:
A.  Intramuscular midazolam
B.  Intravenous lorazepam
C.  Intramuscular diazepam
D.  Oral carbamazepine
E.  Intravenous fosphenytoin

###Answer:","A
Rationale: In a resource-limited setting, intramuscular midazolam is a more appropriate initial treatment for status epilepticus because it is less expensive and easier to administer than intravenous lorazepam. Intramuscular diazepam is also an option, but midazolam is preferred because it has a longer duration of action and is less likely to cause respiratory depression. Intravenous lorazepam and fosphenytoin are not ideal options in a resource-limited setting due to their higher cost and the need for intravenous access. Oral carbamazepine is not an appropriate initial treatment for status epilepticus. 

Note: The question is designed to test the ability to apply knowledge of status epilepticus treatment in a resource-limited setting, which is a critical aspect of emergency medicine in Africa. The correct answer requires consideration of the availability and cost-effectiveness of treatments, as well as the need for rapid and effective intervention in a life-threatening emergency.

B.  Hepatitis E virus (HEV)
C.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
D.  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
E.  Hepatitis A virus (HAV)

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in Africa. HBV infection is endemic in many African countries, and it is estimated that up to 20% of the population in some areas may be infected. Chronic HBV infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in Africa. The high prevalence of HBV infection in Africa is due to a combination of factors, including poor sanitation, lack of access to healthcare, and cultural practices that increase the risk of transmission. In contrast, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is less common in Africa, and hepatitis E virus (HEV) is typically associated with acute hepatitis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can also cause liver disease, but it is not a direct cause of chronic liver disease. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is typically associated with acute hepatitis and is not a common cause of chronic liver disease. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

###Options:
A.  Chest X-ray
B.  Sputum smear microscopy
C.  Blood test for TB antibodies
D.  Tuberculin skin test (TST)
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The tuberculin skin test (TST) is the standard diagnostic test for latent TB infection in Africa. It involves injecting a small amount of tuberculin into the skin and measuring the reaction after 48-72 hours. The TST is widely used in Africa because it is relatively inexpensive and can be performed in resource-poor settings. However, it has some limitations, such as false-positive results in individuals who have been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine or who have been exposed to non-tuberculous mycobacteria. In recent years, blood tests for TB antibodies, such as the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), have been developed as an alternative to the TST. These tests are more specific than the TST but are also more expensive and require specialized equipment. Therefore, the TST remains the standard diagnostic test for latent TB infection in Africa. 

Note: The other options are not correct because chest X-ray is used to diagnose active TB, sputum smear microscopy is used to diagnose active TB and is not specific for latent TB infection, and blood tests for TB antibodies are not widely used in Africa due to their high cost and the need for specialized equipment.

A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","B.  False

Rationale: Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is estimated that over 90% of the global burden of the disease occurs. The disease is caused by parasitic flatworms (schistosomes) that are transmitted through contact with contaminated water. In Africa, the disease is prevalent in many countries, particularly in rural areas where access to clean water and sanitation is limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 200 million people in Africa are infected with schistosomiasis, and that the disease is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the region. Therefore, the statement that less than 50% of people globally affected by schistosomiasis live in Africa is false.  The correct answer is B.  False.  The rationale for this answer is that the majority of the global burden of schistosomiasis occurs in Africa.  The disease is a major public health problem in the region, and it is estimated that over 90% of the global burden of the disease occurs in Africa.

###Options:
A.  28 weeks
B.  22 weeks
C.  30 weeks
D.  16 weeks
E.  19 weeks

###Answer:","A. 28 weeks
Rationale: The survival rate of preterm children in Nigeria is low. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the survival rate of preterm children in Nigeria is around 28 weeks. This is because preterm birth is a major cause of infant mortality in Nigeria, and the country lacks adequate healthcare infrastructure and resources to support the care of preterm babies. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 28 weeks.  The other options are incorrect because they are either too early (B, D, E) or too late (C) for a preterm child to survive in a primary health care centre in Nigeria.

###Options:
A.  Peritonsillar abscess
B.  Acute otitis media
C.  Otitis externa
D.  Sinusitis
E.  Rheumatic heart disease

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is a common cause of acute pharyngitis in children. If left untreated, it can lead to rheumatic fever, which in turn can cause rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease is a significant public health problem in Africa, where it is a leading cause of heart disease and a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. The other options are not directly related to untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in Africa. Peritonsillar abscess (A) is a complication of tonsillitis, not pharyngitis. Acute otitis media (B) is a common childhood illness, but it is not a complication of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Otitis externa (C) is an infection of the outer ear, which is not related to group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Sinusitis (D) is an infection of the sinuses, which can be a complication of upper respiratory tract infections, but it is not a direct complication of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Rheumatic heart disease.  Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify a common complication of untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in Africa.

###Answer:","A

Rationale: Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels. The primary cause of Kaposi's sarcoma is human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). It is more prevalent in Africa compared to other regions. This is due to various factors, including higher rates of HIV/AIDS, which increases the risk of developing Kaposi's sarcoma, and genetic predisposition. Therefore, the statement is true.

###Question: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the transverse colon.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","B.  False

Rationale: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the rectum. The rectum is the part of the large intestine that stores stool until it is eliminated from the body. It is a common site for colorectal cancer, especially in countries with a high incidence of the disease. In Nigeria, the rectum is the most common site for colorectal cancer, accounting for the majority of cases. Therefore, the statement that the commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the transverse colon is false. The transverse colon is a part of the large intestine that connects the descending colon to the ascending colon, and it is not the most common site for colorectal cancer in Nigeria.

###Question: In a rural African setting with limited access to specialized cardiac care, a patient presents with symptoms of infective endocarditis. Which of the following is a common complication of infective endocarditis that may require surgical intervention?
###Options:
A.  Aortic regurgitation
B.  Mitral regurgitation
C.  Ventricular septal defect
D.  Atrial fibrillation
E.  Aortic dissection

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Aortic regurgitation is a common complication of infective endocarditis that may require surgical intervention. It occurs when the infection damages the aortic valve, leading to leakage of blood back into the left ventricle. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. In a rural African setting with limited access to specialized cardiac care, surgical intervention may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged valve. The other options are not as directly related to the complications of infective endocarditis that require surgical intervention. Mitral regurgitation can occur due to infective endocarditis, but it is less common than aortic regurgitation. Ventricular septal defect is a congenital heart defect that can be complicated by infective endocarditis, but it is not a direct complication of the infection. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that can occur in patients with infective endocarditis, but it is not typically a complication that requires surgical intervention. Aortic dissection is a serious condition that can occur in patients with aortic regurgitation, but it is not a direct complication of infective endocarditis. 

Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify a common complication of infective endocarditis that may require surgical intervention in a rural African setting with limited access to specialized cardiac care. The correct answer is based on the understanding of the pathophysiology of infective endocarditis and its complications.

###Options:
A.  Ovarian torsion
B.  Uterine rupture
C.  Placenta previa
D.  Ectopic pregnancy
E.  Preeclampsia

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Uterine rupture is a common cause of obstetric emergencies in Africa. This is due to the high prevalence of obstructed labor, which is often caused by cephalopelvic disproportion. Obstructed labor can lead to uterine rupture, which is a life-threatening condition for both the mother and the baby. In Africa, uterine rupture is a leading cause of maternal mortality, particularly in settings where access to emergency obstetric care is limited. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The other options are not as common causes of obstetric emergencies in Africa. Ovarian torsion is a rare condition that can occur in any woman, but it is not a common cause of obstetric emergencies. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix, but it is not as common in Africa as uterine rupture. Ectopic pregnancy is a condition where the embryo implants outside the uterus, but it is not as common in Africa as uterine rupture. Preeclampsia is a condition characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria, but it is not as common in Africa as uterine rupture. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

A.  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)
B.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
C.  Iron deficiency anemia
D.  Hereditary spherocytosis
E.  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The patient's presentation of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, along with laboratory findings of normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), is most consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). AIHA is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against the patient's own red blood cells, leading to their premature destruction. The positive DAT confirms the presence of these autoantibodies. The patient's African ethnicity may increase the risk of developing AIHA, as certain autoimmune disorders are more prevalent in this population. The other options do not fit the patient's presentation as well as AIHA does. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms, which are not present in this case. Iron deficiency anemia would not cause thrombocytopenia or a positive DAT. Hereditary spherocytosis is a congenital disorder that typically presents in childhood and is not associated with a positive DAT. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, but it would not typically present with a positive DAT. Therefore, AIHA is the most likely diagnosis in this case.  Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.

###Options:
A.  Down syndrome
B.  Cri-du-chat syndrome
C.  Turner syndrome
D.  Fragile X syndrome
E.  Prader-Willi syndrome

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Cri-du-chat syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. The name ""Cri-du-chat"" is French for ""cry of the cat,"" which is a characteristic sound that the children with this condition make. The symptoms of Cri-du-chat syndrome include developmental delay, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphism. The condition is usually associated with a deletion of the 5p15.2 region of chromosome 5. The child in the question is a 5-year-old African child who presents with developmental delay, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphism, and genetic testing reveals a deletion on chromosome 5p. Therefore, Cri-du-chat syndrome is the most likely condition associated with this chromosomal abnormality. Down syndrome is caused by a trisomy of chromosome 21, Turner syndrome is caused by a monosomy of chromosome X, Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation of the FMR1 gene on chromosome X, and Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a deletion of the 15q11-q13 region of chromosome 15.

C.  Adrenal gland tumor
D.  Ectopic ACTH production
E.  Pituitary adenoma

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome in Africa is prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. This is because glucocorticoids are commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and prolonged use can lead to Cushing's syndrome. In contrast, adrenal gland tumors and ectopic ACTH production are less common causes of Cushing's syndrome in Africa. Pituitary adenomas are a common cause of Cushing's disease, but not Cushing's syndrome. Autoimmune disease is not a common cause of Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

B.  Yohimbe bark extract, increasing nitric oxide production and improving blood flow to the prostate
C.  Garlic bulb extract, reducing prostatic inflammation and oxidative stress
D.  African plum tree bark extract, blocking adrenergic receptors in the prostate
E.  Ginseng root extract, promoting apoptosis of prostatic epithelial cells

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Saw palmetto extract is a common indigenous herbal remedy used in Nigeria for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Its proposed mechanism of action is the inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase enzyme activity, which is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent androgen that promotes prostate growth. By inhibiting this enzyme, saw palmetto extract may help reduce prostate size and alleviate symptoms of BPH. This is the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because they describe the mechanisms of action of different herbal remedies, not saw palmetto extract. Yohimbe bark extract, for example, is used to improve erectile function by increasing nitric oxide production and improving blood flow to the penis, not the prostate. Garlic bulb extract has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, but it is not commonly used to treat BPH. African plum tree bark extract is used to treat hypertension, not BPH. Ginseng root extract has various health benefits, but it is not typically used to treat BPH.

###Options:
A.  Painful genital ulcers
B.  Bony deformities
C.  Painless chancre
D.  Recurrent fever
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","C
Rationale: African endemic yaws is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. The primary manifestation of African endemic yaws is a painless chancre, which is a skin lesion that usually appears on the foot or lower leg. The chancre is typically painless and may be accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy. The disease can progress to secondary and tertiary stages, which can cause a range of symptoms, including skin lesions, bone and joint pain, and bony deformities. However, the painless chancre is the most common and characteristic manifestation of African endemic yaws. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because painful genital ulcers are more commonly associated with syphilis. Option B is incorrect because bony deformities are a manifestation of tertiary syphilis, not African endemic yaws. Option D is incorrect because recurrent fever is not a characteristic manifestation of African endemic yaws. Option E is incorrect because option C is a correct answer.  Note: The question is based on the topic of African endemic yaws, which is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. The question requires the test-taker to identify the common manifestation of the disease. The correct answer is a painless chancre, which is a skin lesion that usually appears on the foot or lower leg.

There are several reasons for this. Many infectious diseases, increase the nutritional needs of the body. The body requires additional energy and nutrients to fight off the infection, leading to increased nutrient demands.They can also lead to loss of appetite, reduced food intake, and impaired nutrient absorption. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and other symptoms associated with infections can contribute to poor appetite and decreased absorption of nutrients from the diet. Certain infectious diseases, particularly diarrheal diseases, can cause significant nutrient loss through vomiting and diarrhea. This leads to a depletion of essential nutrients from the body. Finally, some infections can interfere with nutrient utilization and metabolism. For example, malaria can disrupt the body's ability to use nutrients effectively, leading to malnutrition.",5,C,Lack of access to food,Poor sanitation,Infectious diseases,Lack of education,Political instability,"###Instruction: The following are multiple choice questions (MCQs).

D.  Lack of education
E.  Political instability

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Malnutrition in children in Africa is often caused by a combination of factors, but the most common cause is infectious diseases. These diseases can lead to malnutrition by causing diarrhea, which can result in the loss of nutrients and fluids. Additionally, infectious diseases can also lead to a decrease in appetite, which can further exacerbate malnutrition. In Africa, diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, and respiratory infections are common and can contribute to malnutrition in children. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

###Question: Acute pancreatitis is the commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","B.  False

Rationale: Acute abdomen is a common presentation in many conditions, including acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, and perforation of the intestine. Acute pancreatitis is not the commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria. The commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria is acute appendicitis. This is because appendicitis is a common condition in Nigeria and it often presents with acute abdomen. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition that can cause acute abdomen, but it is not the commonest cause in Nigeria.  Acute pancreatitis is more common in developed countries where there is a high incidence of gallstones, which is a common cause of acute pancreatitis. In Nigeria, the common causes of acute pancreatitis include alcohol consumption, gallstones, and infections. However, these causes are not as common as acute appendicitis, which is the commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

###Options:
A.  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
B.  Miliary tuberculosis
C.  Schistosomiasis
D.  Trypanosomiasis
E.  Malaria

###Answer:","C.  Schistosomiasis
Rationale: The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, myalgia, headache, and eosinophilia, along with the chest X-ray findings of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, are suggestive of a parasitic infection. The patient's recent travel to East Africa and the lack of adherence to antimalarials make malaria a less likely diagnosis. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a type of vasculitis that is not typically associated with travel to East Africa or the symptoms described. Miliary tuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis that is characterized by a miliary pattern on chest X-ray, but it is not typically associated with eosinophilia. Trypanosomiasis is a parasitic infection that is transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and is not typically associated with the symptoms described. Schistosomiasis, on the other hand, is a parasitic infection that is transmitted by contact with contaminated water and is common in East Africa. The symptoms of cough, fever, myalgia, headache, and eosinophilia, along with the chest X-ray findings of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, are consistent with schistosomiasis. The itchy rash that the patient experienced in the preceding week is also consistent with schistosomiasis, as it is a common symptom of the disease. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is schistosomiasis.  Note: The question is based on the case study provided in the original text.

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Group A Streptococcus is a common cause of acute glomerulonephritis in African children. This is due to the high prevalence of streptococcal infections in this population, which can lead to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is a complication of streptococcal infections, particularly those caused by Group A Streptococcus.

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The patient's symptoms of persistent sadness, loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, feelings of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts of death are characteristic of major depressive disorder (MDD). These symptoms have been present for at least two weeks and are severe enough to cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning. The patient's symptoms do not meet the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

###Question: The most common agent responsible for burns in Nigeria is which of the following
###Options:
A.  Radiations
B.  Chemicals
C.  Scald
D.  Flame
E.  Electricity

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Scalds are the most common cause of burns in Nigeria. This is due to the fact that most of the population in Nigeria use firewood for cooking. Scalds are burns caused by hot liquids or gases. In Nigeria, the most common cause of scalds is the use of firewood for cooking. The use of firewood for cooking is very common in Nigeria, and it is a major source of scalds. Therefore, the most common agent responsible for burns in Nigeria is scalds.  This is in line with the fact that the most common cause of burns in Nigeria is the use of firewood for cooking.

###Question: Which of the following is the most common cause of chronic cough in Africa 
###Options:
A.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
B.  Asthma
C.  Pneumonia
D.  Chronic bronchitis
E.  Tuberculosis

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Africa and is a common cause of chronic cough in the region. It is estimated that there are approximately 9 million new cases of tuberculosis and 1.5 million deaths due to tuberculosis in Africa each year. In contrast, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and GERD are less common causes of chronic cough in Africa. Pneumonia is a common cause of acute cough, but not chronic cough. Therefore, the most likely answer is E. Tuberculosis.  (Note: The prevalence of chronic cough in Africa may vary depending on the specific region and population being studied.)

###Question: A 30-year-old African patient presents with hives, angioedema, and wheezing shortly after consuming seafood. Which of the following immunoglobulins is most likely involved in this allergic reaction?
###Options:
A.  IgA
B.  IgD
C.  IgE
D.  IgG
E.  IgM

###Answer:","C
Rationale: IgE is the primary antibody responsible for triggering allergic reactions. It binds to mast cells and basophils, leading to the release of histamine and other chemical mediators, which cause symptoms such as hives, angioedema, and wheezing. In this case, the patient's reaction to seafood suggests an IgE-mediated allergic response. IgA is involved in mucosal immunity, IgD is primarily found on mature B cells, IgG is the most abundant antibody in the blood, and IgM is involved in the primary immune response. None of these are directly involved in triggering allergic reactions like the one described.  Note: The question is designed to test the understanding of the role of different immunoglobulins in the immune response, specifically in the context of allergic reactions.

###Options:
A.  Panic disorder
B.  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
C.  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
D.  Social anxiety disorder
E.  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

###Answer:","E
Rationale: In African societies where communal living is common, a patient may present with symptoms of recurrent, intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed in response to these obsessions. This presentation is most consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is characterized by unwanted and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that an individual feels compelled to perform. In some African societies, communal living may lead to a greater emphasis on rituals and compulsions, which can be misinterpreted as OCD. However, the core symptoms of OCD remain the same across cultures. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this scenario is OCD. The other options are incorrect because panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, GAD is characterized by excessive worry, PTSD is characterized by symptoms of anxiety and avoidance following a traumatic event, and social anxiety disorder is characterized by fear of social or performance situations. None of these options match the presentation of recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors or mental acts.

C.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
D.  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
E.  Autoimmune hepatitis

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease in African adults. HBV infection is prevalent in Africa, and it can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is more common in developed countries, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is more common in developed countries with a high prevalence of obesity. Alcoholic liver disease is also a common cause of chronic liver disease, but it is more common in men and in countries with a high prevalence of alcohol consumption. Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare cause of chronic liver disease in Africa. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Avascular necrosis
D.  Septic arthritis
E.  Ankylosing spondylitis

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease characterized by joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. OA is more common in older adults and is often associated with weight-bearing joints, such as the hip. The patient's African ethnicity may also increase his risk for OA, as certain genetic variants have been associated with an increased risk of OA in African populations. The other options are less likely: rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with symmetrical joint involvement and systemic symptoms, avascular necrosis is a condition characterized by bone death due to inadequate blood supply, and septic arthritis is an infection of the joint that typically presents with acute onset of pain, swelling, and fever.

###Answer:","B.  False

Rationale: The commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the rectum. The rectum is the most common site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria, accounting for about 50% of all cases. This is followed by the sigmoid colon, which accounts for about 20% of cases. The descending colon is the least common site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria. This is because the incidence of colorectal cancer is higher in the rectum and sigmoid colon due to the higher prevalence of risk factors such as dietary factors, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition in these regions. Therefore, the statement that the commonest site of colorectal cancer in Nigeria is the descending colon is false.

###Options:
A.  Bloody diarrhea
B.  Projectile vomiting
C.  Rice water stools
D.  Jaundice
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The correct answer is C. Rice water stools. African endemic cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 and O139. The most common presentation of this disease is the sudden onset of profuse, watery diarrhea that resembles rice water, which is a characteristic feature of cholera. This is due to the production of cholera toxin that causes a massive secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions into the intestinal lumen, leading to a significant loss of fluids and electrolytes. Bloody diarrhea (A) is more commonly associated with invasive bacterial pathogens such as Shigella and Salmonella. Projectile vomiting (B) is a feature of cholera, but it is not as specific as rice water stools. Jaundice (D) is not a common presentation of cholera. Therefore, option E is incorrect. Note: The question is asking for the common presentation of African endemic cholera, which is a specific type of cholera.

E.  none

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The patient has a history of HIV and is on antiretroviral therapy. The inactivated hepatitis A vaccine is safe for individuals with HIV. The live-attenuated hepatitis A vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with HIV. The patient has not had a booster dose of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine since he was 2 years old, and he is traveling to an area where hepatitis A is endemic. Therefore, the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine is the most appropriate recommendation. Ribavirin is used to treat viral infections, such as hepatitis C, and is not used for hepatitis A prophylaxis. Reassurance that he does not need another dose is incorrect because the patient has not had a booster dose of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine since he was 2 years old. The live-attenuated hepatitis A vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with HIV. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  Note: The question is based on the topic of HIV and hepatitis A prophylaxis. The rationale is based on the safety of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine in individuals with HIV and the contraindication of the live-attenuated hepatitis A vaccine in individuals with HIV.

###Options:
A.  plasmodium falciparum
B.  plasmodium vivax
C.  plasmodium ovale
D.  plasmodium malariae
E.  plasmodium knowlesi

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent malaria parasite in Africa. It is responsible for the majority of malaria cases and deaths in the region. This parasite is highly virulent and can cause severe and life-threatening disease, particularly in young children and pregnant women. The high prevalence of P. falciparum in Africa is due to a combination of factors, including the parasite's ability to infect humans and mosquitoes, its high reproductive rate, and the lack of effective immunity in the population. As a result, P. falciparum is a major public health concern in Africa and requires targeted control and prevention efforts.

###Question: Acute appendicitis is the commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria.
###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:","B.  False

Rationale: The commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria is intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction is more common than acute appendicitis in Nigeria. This is due to the high prevalence of intestinal worms in Nigeria. Intestinal worms can cause intestinal obstruction by blocking the intestinal lumen. Intestinal obstruction is a surgical emergency and requires prompt treatment. Acute appendicitis is also a surgical emergency but it is less common than intestinal obstruction in Nigeria. Therefore, the statement that acute appendicitis is the commonest cause of acute abdomen in Nigeria is false.

###Options:
A.  malaria
B.  postpartum hemorrhage
C.  HIV/AIDS
D.  hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
E.  Cancer

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The leading cause of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is postpartum hemorrhage. This is due to a combination of factors, including inadequate access to healthcare, lack of skilled birth attendants, and limited availability of essential obstetric care. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), postpartum hemorrhage is responsible for approximately 25% of all maternal deaths globally, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for the majority of these deaths. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because while they are all significant health concerns in sub-Saharan Africa, they are not the leading cause of maternal mortality. Malaria (A) is a major public health problem in the region, but it is not the leading cause of maternal mortality. HIV/AIDS (C) is a significant concern, but it is not the leading cause of maternal mortality. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (D) are a leading cause of maternal mortality globally, but they are not the leading cause in sub-Saharan Africa. Cancer (E) is not a leading cause of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

B.  Subtotal hysterectomy

D.  Injectable long-acting progestogens
E.  Progesterone-only pill (POP)

###Answer:","C.  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS)

Rationale: The LNG-IUS is a highly effective treatment for menorrhagia. It is a first-line treatment for menorrhagia in women who wish to retain their fertility. It is also a good option for women who are not good candidates for hormonal treatments due to the presence of liver disease or other contraindications. The LNG-IUS is a small, T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus and releases a small amount of levonorgestrel, a synthetic form of progesterone, which helps to thin the lining of the uterus and reduce menstrual bleeding. It is a safe and effective treatment for menorrhagia, with a high success rate and minimal side effects. In this case, the patient is not a good candidate for a hysterectomy, as she is still young and wishes to retain her fertility. The LNG-IUS is a good option for her, as it is a reversible treatment that can be removed if she decides to become pregnant in the future. The other options are not the first line of management for menorrhagia in this case. Hysterectomy is a major surgical procedure that is usually reserved for women who have completed their family and have severe menorrhagia that is not responsive to other treatments. Subtotal hysterectomy is not a common procedure and is not typically used to treat menorrhagia. Injectable long-acting progestogens and the progesterone-only pill are hormonal treatments that may be used to treat menorrhagia, but they are not the first line of management in this case.

D.  Maternal mortality fate and ratio are the same
E.  The target of MDGS is to reduce maternal mortality ratio by 50% by 2015

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The big five causes of direct maternal deaths in Kenya are haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disease, abortion and obstructed labour. The maternal mortality ratio is the number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births. The maternal mortality rate is the number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 women of reproductive age per year. The MDG target is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by 75% by 2015. The maternal mortality rate and ratio are not the same. Death from HIV in pregnancy is an indirect maternal death. Kenya has not yet attained the MDG target.  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  Option B is incorrect because death from HIV in pregnancy is an indirect maternal death. Option D is incorrect because the maternal mortality rate and ratio are not the same. Option A is incorrect because Kenya has not yet attained the MDG target. Option E is incorrect because the target of MDG 5 is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by 75% by 2015.  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

E.  The dose of IV quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy, should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency

###Answer:","E
Rationale: The Kenyan protocol for the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy recommends that the dose of IV quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. This is because quinine is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and in patients with renal insufficiency, the drug may accumulate to toxic levels if the dose is not adjusted. Therefore, the correct answer is E.  The dose of IV quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy, should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.  The other options are incorrect because: A.  Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) can be given concomitantly with antiretrovirals, B.  The recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester is a three-day course of chloroquine, C.  Dihydroartemisinin Piperaquine may not be used as IPTp for those who are allergic to sulfur, and D.  Sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp should not be given concomitantly with IFAS for prevention of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy.  The Kenyan protocol for the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy recommends that Sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp should be given at least 1 week apart from IFAS for prevention of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy.  Therefore, the correct answer is E.  The dose of IV quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy, should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.  The other options are incorrect.  The Kenyan protocol for the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy recommends that the dose of IV quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.

###Answer:","D.  d.	All the above

Rationale: Colorectal cancer is less common in Africa compared to other parts of the world. This is due to several factors. Firstly, the population in Africa is relatively young, which means that the incidence of colorectal cancer is lower. Secondly, the diet in Africa is high in fibre, which helps to shorten the transit time of faeces and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Finally, precancerous lesions such as Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis are rare in Africa, which further reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Therefore, all the above factors contribute to the lower incidence of colorectal cancer in Africa.

###Answer:","C.  c.	Sigmoid volvulus
Rationale: Sigmoid volvulus is the commonest cause of large bowel obstruction in Africa. This is due to the high prevalence of sigmoid volvulus in this region. Sigmoid volvulus is a condition where the sigmoid colon twists around its mesenteric axis, leading to obstruction of the bowel. It is more common in older adults and is often associated with chronic constipation, which is prevalent in Africa. The high incidence of sigmoid volvulus in Africa is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including a high-fiber diet, which can lead to chronic constipation, and a higher prevalence of underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of volvulus. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

B.  Plasma glucose level of <2.2 mmol\L
C.  Venous lactate level of <5 mmol\L
D.  More than two generalized seizures in 24 hours
E.  Arterial PH <7.25

###Answer:","C
Rationale: 
Adverse malaria is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. The symptoms of adverse malaria include:
- Severe anemia (e.g., urine output <400 mL in adults)
- Acute kidney injury (e.g., plasma creatinine >3.0 mg/dL)
- Respiratory distress (e.g., respiratory rate >30 breaths/min in adults)
- Cerebral malaria (e.g., more than two generalized seizures in 24 hours)
- Metabolic acidosis (e.g., arterial pH <7.25)
- Hypoglycemia (e.g., plasma glucose level <2.2 mmol/L)

Venous lactate level of <5 mmol/L is not a symptom of adverse malaria. In fact, a lactate level of <5 mmol/L is generally considered to be within the normal range. A lactate level of >5 mmol/L is often used as a marker of severe metabolic acidosis, which is a symptom of adverse malaria. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. 

Note: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines severe malaria as the presence of one or more of the following symptoms: impaired consciousness, coma, convulsions, or severe anemia. The WHO also recommends the use of a lactate level of >5 mmol/L as a marker of severe metabolic acidosis. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the symptoms of adverse malaria and to be able to identify the option that is not a symptom. The correct answer is not a symptom of adverse malaria, and the test-taker must be able to eliminate the other options, which are all symptoms of adverse malaria. 

This type of question is appropriate for assessing the test-taker's knowledge of the subject matter and their ability to apply that knowledge to identify the correct answer. It requires the test-taker to think critically and to analyze the options carefully. 

In terms of Bloom's Taxonomy, this question is at the level of ""Analysis"" because it requires the test-taker to break down the information and to identify the correct answer based on that analysis. It is not a simple recall question, but rather a question that requires the test-taker to think critically and to apply their knowledge in a practical way. 

This type of question is also appropriate for assessing the test-taker's ability to identify the pros and cons of different options. In this case,",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7186288,0.86407137,0.7846673

B.  Ceftriaxone and clarithromycin
C.  Vancomycin
D.  Linezolid
E.  Co-amoxiclav and levofloxacin

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Co-amoxiclav is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The combination of co-amoxiclav and levofloxacin is recommended for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are both fluoroquinolone antibiotics, but they are not typically used together. Ceftriaxone and clarithromycin are both broad-spectrum antibiotics, but they are not typically used together for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is typically used for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that is typically used for the treatment of MRSA infections and other resistant Gram-positive infections.

Rationale: MDR TB is defined as TB that is resistant to at least both isoniazid and rifampicin. This is a serious form of TB that is difficult to treat and requires a longer treatment regimen. The other options are incorrect because they describe TB that is resistant to one or two drugs, but not both isoniazid and rifampicin. Option A describes TB that is resistant to isoniazid, but not rifampicin. Option B describes TB that is resistant to pyrazinamide, but not rifampicin. Option C describes TB that is resistant to injectable anti-TB drugs, but not necessarily to isoniazid and rifampicin.

###Options:
A.  Cefuroxime
B.  Ceftriaxone
C.  Cefepime
D.  Amoxicillin
E.  All of the above

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is recommended as the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis pending culture results. Ceftriaxone is effective against common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. It is administered intravenously and has a long half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing. Ceftriaxone is generally well-tolerated, with common side effects including diarrhea, nausea, and injection site reactions. In severe cases of bacterial meningitis, ceftriaxone may be used in combination with other antibiotics, such as vancomycin, to cover for potential resistant strains. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  Cefuroxime (option A) is a second-generation cephalosporin with activity against Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria, but it is not as effective as ceftriaxone against certain pathogens. Cefepime (option C) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis. Amoxicillin (option D) is a penicillin antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but it is not effective against many Gram-negative bacteria and is not recommended as a first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis. Therefore, options A, C, and D are incorrect.  Option E is incorrect because only ceftriaxone is recommended as the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis pending culture results.  Therefore, the correct answer is option B.  Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is recommended as the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis pending culture results. Ceftriaxone is effective against common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae.

###Question: Which is the commonest etiology of acute bacterial meningitis in adults
###Options:
A.  Streptococcus pneumonia
B.  Haemophilus influenza
C.  Staphylococcus aureus
D.  Neisseria meningitidis
E.  Listeria monocytogenes

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is due to the fact that Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and can easily invade the bloodstream and cause meningitis. It is also a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to meningitis. The other options are less common causes of bacterial meningitis in adults. Haemophilus influenzae type b is more commonly seen in children, while Neisseria meningitidis is more commonly seen in young adults. Listeria monocytogenes is more commonly seen in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Staphylococcus aureus is a rare cause of bacterial meningitis. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Note: The question is asking for the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults, not the most common cause in general. The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in general is Streptococcus pneumoniae, but in children, Haemophilus influenzae type b is more common. In young adults, Neisseria meningitidis is more common. In the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, Listeria monocytogenes is more common.

###Question: CURB-65 is used to assess the severity of pneumonia. Which of the following is not a component of the score
###Options:
A.  Creatinine
B.  Urea
C.  Blood pressure
D.  Age
E.  Respiratory rate

###Answer:","B
Rationale: CURB-65 is a clinical prediction rule used to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia. It consists of five components: Confusion, Urea > 7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, Blood pressure < 90 mmHg systolic or diastolic ≤ 60 mmHg, and Age ≥ 65 years. Urea is a component of the CURB-65 score, but urea > 7 mmol/L is the specific criterion. Therefore, option B is not the correct answer. The other options are all components of the CURB-65 score. Option A is a component of the CRB-65 score, which is a variation of the CURB-65 score that uses creatinine instead of urea. However, the CURB-65 score specifically uses urea. Option C is a component of the CURB-65 score. Option D is a component of the CURB-65 score. Option E is a component of the CURB-65 score. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  Note: The CRB-65 score is a variation of the CURB-65 score that uses creatinine instead of urea. The CRB-65 score is used to assess the severity of pneumonia in patients who are admitted to the hospital. The CRB-65 score consists of four components: Confusion, Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, Blood pressure < 90 mmHg systolic or diastolic ≤ 60 mmHg, and Age ≥ 65 years. The CRB-65 score is used to predict the risk of mortality in patients with pneumonia. The CURB-65 score is used to assess the severity of pneumonia in patients who are admitted to the hospital.

B.  Anti-tuberculous drugs should be started first
C.  Anti-retroviral drugs should be started first
D.  None of the above
E.  All of the above

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The correct answer is B. Anti-tuberculous drugs should be started first. The reason is that TB treatment is more effective when started early, and delaying TB treatment can lead to drug resistance. In contrast, delaying ART (anti-retroviral therapy) does not lead to drug resistance. Therefore, TB treatment should be started first, followed by ART. This approach is known as the ""TB-ART"" strategy. This strategy is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

Note: The other options are incorrect because starting ART and TB treatment at the same time (A) can lead to drug interactions and decreased effectiveness of both treatments. Starting ART first (C) can delay TB treatment and increase the risk of drug resistance. Option D is incorrect because option B is correct. Option E is incorrect because option B is correct and the other options are incorrect.  End of rationale.

D.  Rapid malaria tests have lower sensitivity compare to microscopy
E.  Plasmodium ovale is the commonest species causing malaria in Kenya

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Thick slides have higher sensitivity compared to thin slides on microscopy because they contain more blood and therefore more parasites. This makes them more useful for detecting low levels of parasitemia. Thin slides, on the other hand, are more useful for species identification. Therefore, option C is correct. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect. Plasmodium falciparum can infect immature red blood cells. Plasmodium malariae is associated with chronic infection, not relapse.

###Question: During AIDS, Hiv infects?
###Options:
A.  CD3 lymphocytes
B.  CD4 lymphocytes
C.  NK cells
D.  T-helper cells
E.  CD2 lymphocytes

###Answer:","B
Rationale: HIV primarily infects CD4+ T cells, also known as T helper cells. These cells are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. The virus infects these cells by binding to the CD4 receptor on their surface. Once infected, the virus can replicate and cause damage to the immune system, leading to the symptoms and complications associated with AIDS. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. 

Note: CD3 is a component of the T-cell receptor complex, NK cells are a type of lymphocyte that does not express CD4, T-helper cells are another name for CD4+ T cells, and CD2 is a different receptor on T cells. While these options may seem related to the immune system, they are not the primary target of HIV infection. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the basic biology of HIV and its effects on the immune system. It also requires the ability to analyze the options and choose the correct one based on that knowledge. 

This type of question is relevant to the topic of immunology and infectious diseases, and is appropriate for a test or exam in these areas. It requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of the subject to a specific scenario, making it a good assessment of their understanding of the material. 

In terms of Bloom's Taxonomy, this question requires the test-taker to recall and apply knowledge, as well as analyze and evaluate information. It is a higher-level thinking question that requires more than just memorization of facts. 

This type of question is also relevant to the topic of AIDS and HIV, which is a critical area of study in the fields of immunology and infectious diseases. Understanding the biology of HIV and its effects on the immune system is essential for developing effective treatments and prevention strategies. 

Therefore, this question is a good assessment of the test-taker's knowledge and understanding of the subject, and is relevant to the topic of AIDS and HIV. 

In terms of the format of the question, it is a multiple-choice question with a clear and concise stem and options. The options are relevant to the topic and require the test-taker to have knowledge of the subject to choose the correct answer. The question is also self-contained, meaning that the test-taker does not need to refer to any external resources or information to answer the question.

###Options:
A.  Reverse transcriptase
B.  DNA polymerase
C.  RNA polymerase
D.  Core Antigen
E.  None of these

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The correct answer is A. Reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that is unique to retroviruses, including HIV. It is responsible for converting the viral RNA into DNA, which can then be integrated into the host cell's genome. The presence of reverse transcriptase in a blood sample is a marker of HIV infection. The other options are not specific markers of HIV infection. DNA polymerase is a general enzyme involved in DNA replication, RNA polymerase is involved in transcription, and core antigen is a protein component of the virus, but not a specific marker of HIV infection. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.  The rationale is based on the fact that reverse transcriptase is a unique enzyme of retroviruses and is a marker of HIV infection. The other options are not specific markers of HIV infection. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option and then provide a rationale for your answer. 

###Question: The interval period between HIV infection and appearance of antibodies in serum is called?
###Options:
A.  Intrinsic Period
B.  Window Period
C.  Incubation Period
D.  Replication Phase
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The window period is the time between when a person is infected with HIV and when the virus can be detected by a test. This period is usually 23 days after exposure for the standard HIV test, but it can be longer for some tests. During this time, the person may not test positive for HIV, even if they are infected. The window period is also known as the ""seroconversion period"" because it is the time it takes for the body to produce antibodies against the virus. The incubation period, on the other hand, is the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms. The intrinsic period is not a term used in the context of HIV infection. The replication phase is a term used in the context of viral replication, but it is not the correct answer to this question. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Window Period.

###Options:
A.  Tuberculous meningitis
B.  Cryptococcal meningitis
C.  Bacterial meningitis
D.  Viral meningitis
E.  All of the above

###Answer:","C
Rationale: In bacterial meningitis, the intracranial pressure is high due to the inflammatory response and the presence of bacteria. Serial lumbar puncture is recommended to reduce the intracranial pressure and prevent brain herniation. This is a controversial topic, and the decision to perform serial lumbar puncture should be made on a case-by-case basis. The other options are not correct because tuberculous meningitis and cryptococcal meningitis are typically managed with antitubercular therapy and antifungal therapy, respectively, and serial lumbar puncture is not typically recommended. Viral meningitis is usually self-limiting and does not require serial lumbar puncture.

###Options:
A.  Community-acquired pneumonia
B.  Chronic bronchitis
C.  Emphysema
D.  Tuberculosis
E.  Pulmonary embolism

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain are suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's age and the acute onset of symptoms make community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) the most likely diagnosis. CAP is an infection of the lung parenchyma acquired outside of a hospital setting. It is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The symptoms of CAP can range from mild to severe and include fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, and shortness of breath. The patient's age and the acute onset of symptoms make CAP the most likely diagnosis. The other options are less likely: chronic bronchitis and emphysema are chronic conditions that would not present acutely, and tuberculosis is a chronic infection that would not present with such acute symptoms. Pulmonary embolism is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of an infectious process.  Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and presentation. The correct answer requires an understanding of the common causes of pneumonia and the typical presentation of CAP.

###Question: The commonest site for extrapulmonary tuberculosis is?
###Options:
A.  Cervical lymph nodes

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The commonest site for extrapulmonary tuberculosis is the cervical lymph nodes. This is because the lymph nodes are the first point of contact for the bacteria when they enter the body through the respiratory tract. The bacteria can then spread to other parts of the body through the lymphatic system. The other options are also possible sites for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, but they are less common than the cervical lymph nodes. Pleural TB is the second most common form of extrapulmonary TB, followed by TB meningitis and bone and joint TB. Miliary TB is a form of TB that affects the entire body, but it is not a specific site for extrapulmonary TB.

###Answer:","D.  d)	Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
Rationale: BCG is a live attenuated vaccine. It is used to protect against tuberculosis. The BCG vaccine is given at birth in Malawi. The other options are not live vaccines. Diphtheria, Haemophilus influenza type b, Hepatitis B and Tetanus vaccines are all inactivated vaccines.  Inactivated vaccines are made from killed or inactivated pathogens. They cannot cause the disease they are designed to prevent. Live vaccines, on the other hand, contain a weakened form of the pathogen. They can cause a mild form of the disease, but they provide long-lasting immunity. Live vaccines are often used to protect against diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella. They are also used to protect against diseases such as polio and chickenpox. Live vaccines are often given to children as part of their routine vaccination schedule. They are also used to protect against diseases such as influenza and shingles. Live vaccines are often given to adults as part of their routine vaccination schedule. They are also used to protect against diseases such as HPV and hepatitis A. Live vaccines are often given to people who are at high risk of contracting a particular disease. They are also used to protect against diseases such as meningitis and pneumococcal disease. Live vaccines are often given to people who are traveling to areas where a particular disease is common.

B.  It is a known cause of acute kidney injury
C.  Diagnosis is by Widal test
D.  Responds to ciprofloxacin
E.  Antibiotics are not necessary for cure

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The Widal test is used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, not cholera. Cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae and is diagnosed by stool culture or rapid diagnostic tests. The stool in cholera is described as rice water in appearance due to the presence of mucus and flecks of bile. Cholera can cause acute kidney injury due to dehydration and shock. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin are used to treat cholera, especially in severe cases. Antibiotics are not always necessary for cure, but they can reduce the duration and severity of the illness.  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  The other options are true about cholera.  Option A is true because the stool in cholera is described as rice water in appearance.  Option B is true because cholera can cause acute kidney injury.  Option D is true because ciprofloxacin is used to treat cholera.  Option E is true because antibiotics are not always necessary for cure, but they can reduce the duration and severity of the illness.  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  The other options are true about cholera.  Option A is true because the stool in cholera is described as rice water in appearance.  Option B is true because cholera can cause acute kidney injury.  Option D is true because ciprofloxacin is used to treat cholera.

Rationale: Amoxicillin is not the drug of choice for typhoid fever. The recommended treatment for typhoid fever is with fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefixime), or azithromycin. Amoxicillin is not effective against Salmonella Typhi. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  The other options are all effective against Salmonella Typhi.  Ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, cefixime, and cefotaxime are all used to treat typhoid fever.  Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and cefixime are third-generation cephalosporins, and ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone.  All of these drugs are effective against Salmonella Typhi.  Therefore, options A, B, D, and E are incorrect.  The correct answer is C.  Amoxicillin is not the drug of choice for typhoid fever.

###Options:
A.  ‘Ground’ itch
B.  Hepatomegaly
C.  Bladder cancer
D.  Katayama fever
E.  Spinal cord compression

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Spinal cord compression is not a clinical manifestation of schistosomiasis. The other options are all possible manifestations of schistosomiasis. ‘Ground’ itch is a symptom of the acute phase of the disease, caused by the penetration of the skin by cercariae. Hepatomegaly is a symptom of the chronic phase of the disease, caused by the liver granulomas. Bladder cancer is a long-term complication of chronic infection with Schistosoma haematobium. Katayama fever is a symptom of the acute phase of the disease, caused by the body's reaction to the eggs of the parasite. Spinal cord compression is a complication of spinal cord schistosomiasis, which is caused by Schistosoma mansoni. However, this is extremely rare and is not a common manifestation of the disease. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Spinal cord compression.  Note: The question is asking for the option that is NOT a clinical manifestation of schistosomiasis.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option and then provide a rationale for your answer. 

###Question: Which one of the following is not an expected finding in the CSF of a patient with bacterial meningitis?

###Options:
A.  Pleocytosis
B.  High glucose levels
C.  Positive latex agglutination
D.  High protein levels
E.  Absent red blood cells

###Answer:","B.  High glucose levels

Rationale: In bacterial meningitis, the glucose levels in the CSF are typically low, not high. This is because the bacteria and the inflammatory cells consume glucose, leading to a decrease in its concentration in the CSF. The other options are all expected findings in bacterial meningitis: pleocytosis (an increase in the number of white blood cells) is a hallmark of the condition, latex agglutination is a test used to detect bacterial antigens in the CSF, and high protein levels are also a common finding due to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The absence of red blood cells is also expected, as bacterial meningitis typically does not cause bleeding into the CSF. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. 

Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify an incorrect statement about bacterial meningitis, which is a key aspect of critical thinking and clinical reasoning in medicine.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option and then provide a rationale for your answer. 

###Question: Which of the following is a cause of atypical pneumonia?

###Options:
A.  Streptococcus pneumoniae
B.  Haemophilus influenza
C.  Moraxella catarrhalis
D.  Mycoplasma pneumonia
E.  Group A streptococci

###Answer:","D.  Mycoplasma pneumonia

Rationale: Mycoplasma pneumonia is a common cause of atypical pneumonia, which is characterized by its non-bacterial etiology and atypical clinical presentation. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small, cell-wall-free bacterium that can cause respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in humans. It is typically seen in young adults and is often associated with outbreaks in crowded environments, such as schools and military barracks. The symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumonia can be similar to those of typical bacterial pneumonia, but it often presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and a higher incidence of extrapulmonary manifestations, such as rash and conjunctivitis. The diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonia is often made based on clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and response to treatment. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, such as macrolides and tetracyclines, which are effective against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are incorrect because Streptococcus pneumoniae (option A) is a common cause of typical bacterial pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza (option B) and Moraxella catarrhalis (option C) are also common causes of typical bacterial pneumonia, and Group A streptococci (option E) are typically associated with pharyngitis and skin infections, rather than pneumonia.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option and then provide a rationale for your answer. 

###Question: Which of the following is not a risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia?
###Options:
A.  Alcoholism
B.  Diabetes
C.  COPD
D.  Endotracheal intubation for 5 days
E.  Steroid use

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Endotracheal intubation for 5 days is a risk factor for hospital-acquired pneumonia, not community-acquired pneumonia. The other options are all risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia. Alcoholism, diabetes, COPD, and steroid use are all associated with an increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia due to impaired immune function, increased susceptibility to infection, and other factors. Endotracheal intubation for 5 days, on the other hand, is a risk factor for hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is a different entity. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is typically caused by more virulent organisms and is often associated with longer hospital stays and more severe illness. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.  Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify a risk factor that is not associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and the correct answer is based on the understanding of the differences between community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

###Question: Vaccination is a prevention method for all the following infections except
###Options:
A.  Pneumococcal pneumonia
B.  Haemophilus influenza meningitis
C.  Meningococcal septicaemia
D.  Brucellosis
E.  Tetanus

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection, which means it is transmitted from animals to humans. Vaccination is not a recommended prevention method for brucellosis. The other options are all infections for which vaccination is a recommended prevention method. Pneumococcal pneumonia can be prevented with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine is used to prevent Hib meningitis. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is used to prevent meningococcal septicaemia. Tetanus vaccine is used to prevent tetanus.  Therefore, the correct answer is D. Brucellosis.  This question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of prevention methods for various infections, and to identify the one infection for which vaccination is not a recommended prevention method.  This requires analysis and evaluation of the options, as well as knowledge of the subject matter.  The question is self-contained, and the answer can be determined without reference to the provided text.  The question is also relevant to the topic of infectious diseases, and requires the test-taker to think critically about the prevention methods for various infections.

###Question: Which of these does not cause watery diarrhea
###Options:
A.  Norovirus
B.  Cryptosporidium
C.  Vibrio cholerae
D.  Shigella
E.  Staphylococcus aureus

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Shigella causes dysentery, which is characterized by bloody diarrhea, not watery diarrhea. The other options all cause watery diarrhea. Norovirus and Vibrio cholerae cause watery diarrhea through mechanisms that involve the small intestine. Cryptosporidium causes watery diarrhea through mechanisms that involve the small intestine. Staphylococcus aureus causes watery diarrhea through mechanisms that involve the small intestine. Shigella causes bloody diarrhea through mechanisms that involve the large intestine. Therefore, Shigella is the correct answer.  This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the pathophysiology of the different pathogens that cause diarrhea.

D.  Tuberculous lymphadenitis explains the findings
E.  Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The patient has symptoms of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is the first-line treatment for PCP. Macrolides are used as an alternative in patients who cannot tolerate cotrimoxazole. Dapsone is used as a second-line treatment in patients who do not respond to macrolides. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because cryptococcosis is a different opportunistic infection that typically presents with a headache, fever, and altered mental status. Option C is incorrect because dapsone has a role in the management of PCP. Option D is incorrect because tuberculous lymphadenitis is a different condition that typically presents with lymphadenopathy. Option E is incorrect because oral corticosteroids are not indicated in PCP. In fact, corticosteroids can worsen the prognosis of PCP. The correct answer is B.

###Answer:","B.  Rome criteria

Rationale: The Rome criteria are the most widely used criteria for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). They were first published in 1990 and have been updated several times since then. The Rome criteria are based on the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation, and are divided into different subtypes based on the predominant bowel habit. The Rome criteria are widely used by gastroenterologists and other healthcare professionals to diagnose IBS and to distinguish it from other gastrointestinal disorders. The other options are not correct because they are not widely used or recognized criteria for the diagnosis of IBS. 

Note: The Rome criteria are also used for the diagnosis of other functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia and functional constipation. 

Explanation: The Rome criteria are a set of diagnostic criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). They were first published in 1990 and have been updated several times since then.

E.  He should delay anti-retroviral therapy in HIV/TB co-infected patients till they complete TB therapy

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The N-95 Filter is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation. The N-95 Filter is a type of respirator mask that filters out 95% of airborne particles, including bacteria and viruses. It is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing the inhalation of aerosols, which can contain TB bacteria. The other options are incorrect because: A) BCG vaccination is not effective in preventing pulmonary TB in adults. B) A positive Mantoux test indicates exposure to TB, not excellent protection against TB. D) IPT is recommended for HIV patients with a CD4 count < 350 cells/μL, regardless of symptoms. E) Anti-retroviral therapy should not be delayed in HIV/TB co-infected patients. In fact, early initiation of anti-retroviral therapy is recommended to improve outcomes in patients with HIV/TB co-infection.

E.  Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy should be given to all patients with a CD4 < 100cells/uL when they are initiating antiretroviral treatment

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The statement is true. Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months. The other options are not true. Universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is not mandatory for all patients unless contraindicated. Dapsone can be used when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated for prophylaxis but should be continued for at least 6 months after the CD4 count is >200 cells/uL. Primary prophylaxis for PCP should be continued indefinitely if the CD4 count is <200 cells/uL. A course of Isoniazid preventive therapy should be offered to all patients with a CD4 < 200 cells/uL, not just those with a history of TB contact. Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy should be given to all patients with a CD4 < 100 cells/uL when they are initiating antiretroviral treatment.  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

###Options:
A.  An intercurrent infection can cause this
B.  He should have adherence counseling and directly observed treatment and repeat the viral load in a year
C.  A repeat viral load should be done in 6 months and if similar levels are obtained, he should be switched to a second-line regimen
D.  The viremia would be expected to continue rising with time
E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The patient has a detectable viral load, which is a sign of treatment failure. The first step is to assess the patient's adherence to the current regimen. If the patient is found to be adherent, then the regimen should be changed to a second-line regimen. The patient should have adherence counseling and a repeat viral load in 6 months. If the viral load is still detectable, then the patient should be switched to a second-line regimen. The patient should not be switched to a second-line regimen based on a single detectable viral load. The patient should not be switched to a second-line regimen based on a single detectable viral load.

D.  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can be used to treat both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections
E.  Boosting with ritonavir increases the metabolism of the partner drug, thereby reducing toxicity

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor that exerts its action by binding to gp41, a subunit of the HIV envelope protein. This prevents the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, thereby preventing the entry of the virus into the host cell. The other options are incorrect: A is incorrect because Zidovudine is a thymidine analog, but Abacavir is a carbovir analog. B is incorrect because Dolutegravir has a high genetic barrier to resistance. D is incorrect because Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are generally ineffective against HIV-2. E is incorrect because boosting with ritonavir increases the levels of the partner drug, thereby reducing the required dose and increasing the risk of toxicity.

E.  Isoniazid prophylaxis is indicated for patients with a CD4 < 100 cells/uL.

###Answer:","B

Rationale: The correct answer is B. Active TB accelerates HIV disease. The presence of active TB accelerates the progression of HIV disease, leading to a more rapid decline in CD4 counts. This is because the immune system is already compromised in HIV-infected individuals, making them more susceptible to TB. The other options are incorrect: A is incorrect because the lifetime risk for developing active TB in HIV-infected individuals is 10 times that of HIV-uninfected individuals, not twice. C is incorrect because antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated as soon as possible in patients with HIV and TB, regardless of CD4 count.

C.  CD4 B lymphocytes and macrophages are the primary target of infection
D.  The seroconversion window period refers to the time from infection to the time when the laboratory is able to detect HIV antibodies
E.  The Oral HIV test demonstrates that there is some risk of transmission from oral secretions.

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The seroconversion window period refers to the time from infection to the time when the laboratory is able to detect HIV antibodies. This is the time when the individual is most infectious. The p24 antigen can be detected during the window period, but not during the eclipse period. The humoral immune response is not more effective than the cell-mediated immune response in controlling the infection. CD4 T lymphocytes are the primary target of infection, not CD4 B lymphocytes or macrophages. The Oral HIV test does not demonstrate that there is some risk of transmission from oral secretions. The Oral HIV test is a screening test that detects HIV antibodies in oral fluids. It is not a diagnostic test and should not be used to determine the risk of transmission. The risk of transmission from oral secretions is very low and is not related to the Oral HIV test. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Rationale: Trachoma is a chronic infection of the eye caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The disease is characterized by the formation of follicles and papillae in the palpebral conjunctiva. The patient is infectious when there are follicles and papillae in the palpebral conjunctiva. Arlt's line is a scarring of the upper tarsal conjunctiva, Herbert's pits are depressions in the cornea, and post-trachomatous concretions are small, hard, white or yellowish bodies that form in the conjunctiva.

D.  300ml/day
E.  100ml/day

###Answer:","B. 200ml/day
Rationale: The rate of CSF production is approximately 500 ml/day. However, the rate of CSF production is not the same as the rate of CSF turnover. The rate of CSF turnover is approximately 200 ml/day. This is because the CSF is constantly being produced and reabsorbed. The rate of CSF production is higher than the rate of CSF turnover because the CSF is being reabsorbed at the same time it is being produced. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 200ml/day.  The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the rate of CSF production or turnover. Option A is too high, option C is too low, option D is too low, and option E is too low.  The rate of CSF production is approximately 500 ml/day, but the rate of CSF turnover is approximately 200 ml/day.  Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Rationale: Ulcerative colitis typically starts in the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous manner. The backwash ileitis is a rare phenomenon where the inflammation extends about 1-2 cm into the terminal ileum. Therefore, the part of the colon involved when this is seen is the rectum. The other options are not correct as the backwash ileitis is a rare extension of the inflammation into the terminal ileum, not the ascending, transverse or descending colon. The whole colon is involved in ulcerative colitis, but the backwash ileitis specifically refers to the extension into the terminal ileum.

###Options:
A.  Stroke
B.  Transverse myelitis
C.  Poliomyelitis
D.  Miller-Fisher syndrome
E.  Botulism

###Answer:","D. Miller-Fisher syndrome

Rationale: Miller-Fisher syndrome is a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome, characterized by the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. It typically follows an antecedent infection, often of the upper respiratory tract. The patient's symptoms of ascending weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxic gait are consistent with this diagnosis. The other options are not as likely given the patient's symptoms and history. Stroke would typically present with sudden onset of focal neurological deficits, transverse myelitis would present with sensory and motor deficits below the level of the lesion, poliomyelitis is a viral infection that causes acute flaccid paralysis, and botulism is a toxin-mediated illness that causes descending weakness. 

Note: Miller-Fisher syndrome is a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome, but it is not listed as an option. However, given the patient's symptoms and history, it is the most likely diagnosis. If you are not familiar with Miller-Fisher syndrome, you may choose Guillain-Barre syndrome as the correct answer.

###Answer:","C.  Campylobacter jejuni

Rationale: The clinical presentation of acute onset ascending paralysis following a diarrhoeal illness is suggestive of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disorder that occurs after an infection, most commonly caused by Campylobacter jejuni. The infection triggers an immune response that damages the myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. The other options are not typically associated with GBS. Salmonella typhi is associated with typhoid fever, Clostridium tetani causes tetanus, Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia, and Vibrio cholerae causes cholera.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The mechanism of diarrhea in cholera is secretory. Cholera toxin, produced by Vibrio cholerae, stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions into the intestinal lumen, leading to a net secretion of fluid into the lumen and resulting in watery diarrhea. This is a classic example of secretory diarrhea. The other options are not correct because osmotic diarrhea is caused by the presence of non-absorbable substances in the intestine, inflammatory diarrhea is caused by an inflammatory process in the intestine, infective diarrhea is caused by a pathogen that invades the intestinal mucosa, and dysmotility diarrhea is caused by abnormal movement of the intestine. None of these mechanisms are involved in cholera.

E.  Appendicitis is not common in sub Saharan Africa

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The most common symptom of appendicitis in sub-Saharan Africa is right iliac fossa pain. This is because the disease is more common in this region and the symptoms are more pronounced. The classic symptoms of appendicitis, such as vague periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, are less common in sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, patients often present with more severe symptoms, such as right iliac fossa pain, which is a more specific indicator of appendicitis. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

###Question: A 49-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a seizure. He does not have a history of seizures and he currently takes no medications. He has AIDS and is not under any care at this time. His physical examination is most notable for small, shoddy lymphadenopathy in the cervical region.

His serum Toxoplasma IgG is positive. Which of the following is the best course of action for this patient at this time?
###Options:
A.  Biopsy of the central nervous system (CNS) lesion
B.  Dexamethasone
C.  Search for systemic malignancy
D.  Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis
E.  Whole-brain radiation therapy

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The patient has AIDS and a ring-enhancing lesion in the temporal lobe, which is suggestive of CNS toxoplasmosis. The presence of Toxoplasma IgG antibodies in the serum supports this diagnosis. CNS toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of focal brain lesions in AIDS patients. The best course of action is to start treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis, which typically consists of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, along with folinic acid to prevent bone marrow suppression. The patient should also be started on prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. A biopsy of the CNS lesion is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is highly suggestive based on the clinical presentation and serology. Dexamethasone may be used to treat edema, but it is not the best course of action at this time. A search for systemic malignancy is not indicated, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs suggestive of cancer. Whole-brain radiation therapy is not indicated, as the patient has a treatable condition. (Choice A) is incorrect because a biopsy of the CNS lesion is not necessary in this case. (Choice B) is incorrect because dexamethasone is not the best course of action at this time. (Choice C) is incorrect because a search for systemic malignancy is not indicated. (Choice E) is incorrect because whole-brain radiation therapy is not indicated. Instruction: The following are multiple choice questions (MCQs).

###Question: What is the commonest cause of peptic ulcer disease in Malawi? 





###Options:
A.  Alcohol
B.  H.pylori
C.  Genetics
D.  Idiopathic

###Answer:","B.  H.pylori

Rationale: The commonest cause of peptic ulcer disease in Malawi is Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. H. pylori is a type of bacteria that can cause peptic ulcers by damaging the lining of the stomach and small intestine. In Malawi, H. pylori infection is a major public health problem, and it is estimated that up to 70% of the population is infected with the bacteria. The infection is often acquired in childhood, and it can lead to chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and an increased risk of stomach cancer. Therefore, the correct answer is B. H. pylori. 

Note: The other options are not correct because while alcohol can contribute to the development of peptic ulcers, it is not the commonest cause in Malawi. Genetics can play a role in the development of peptic ulcers, but it is not the primary cause. Idiopathic peptic ulcers are those that occur without a known cause, but H. pylori infection is the most common cause of peptic ulcers in Malawi.  .

###Options:
A.  Nephrotic syndrome
B.  Disseminated TB
C.  HIV associated nephropathy
D.  Acute kidney injury

###Answer:","C.  HIV associated nephropathy

Rationale: The patient presents with anasarca, significant proteinuria, hematuria and low serum albumin. These findings are suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. However, the patient is HIV positive and the presence of hematuria and low serum albumin in the context of HIV infection points towards HIV associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a cause of nephrotic syndrome in HIV positive patients and is characterized by the presence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on renal biopsy. The other options are not likely in this case. Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by a variety of conditions including minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy and FSGS but the presence of hematuria and HIV infection points towards HIVAN. Disseminated TB can cause renal failure but it is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. Acute kidney injury can cause renal failure but it is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. 

Note: HIVAN is a cause of nephrotic syndrome in HIV positive patients and is characterized by the presence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on renal biopsy. The other options are not likely in this case. Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by a variety of conditions including minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy and FSGS but the presence of hematuria and HIV infection points towards HIVAN. Disseminated TB can cause renal failure but it is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. Acute kidney injury can cause renal failure but it is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. 

This question requires the nurse to have knowledge of the relationship between HIV infection and renal disease, and to be able to apply this knowledge to a clinical scenario. It also requires the nurse to be able to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results to arrive at a likely diagnosis. 

This question is relevant to the topic of HIV and renal disease, and is appropriate for a nurse who is working in a clinical setting and needs to be able to diagnose and manage patients with HIV and renal disease.

###Options:
A.  Trauma
B.  Tuberculosis
C.  Streptococcus pneumoniae
D.  Idiopathic

###Answer:","B.  Tuberculosis

Rationale: Tuberculosis is a common cause of pericardial effusion in low resource countries. It is a major public health problem in many developing countries, including Malawi. The prevalence of tuberculosis in Malawi is high, and it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the country. Tuberculosis can cause pericardial effusion through direct extension from an adjacent infected lymph node or through hematogenous spread. In low resource settings, tuberculosis is often the commonest cause of pericardial effusion, making it a significant public health concern. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Tuberculosis. 

Note: The other options are not the commonest cause of pericardial effusion in low resource countries. Trauma (A) is a common cause of pericardial effusion in high resource countries, but not in low resource countries. Streptococcus pneumoniae (C) is a common cause of pericardial effusion in high resource countries, but not in low resource countries. Idiopathic (D) is a term used to describe a condition that is not caused by a known factor, and it is not a common cause of pericardial effusion in low resource countries.  . 

Note: The question is designed to test the knowledge of the candidate on the common causes of pericardial effusion in low resource countries.

C.  C.Blantyre coma score of4/5
D.  D.Urinalysis showing blood in urine

###Answer:","C.  C.Blantyre coma score of4/5

Rationale: The Blantyre coma scale is a clinical tool used to assess the severity of malaria. It is used to assess the level of consciousness in a patient with malaria. A score of 4/5 indicates a severe level of malaria, which is life-threatening. The other options are not directly related to the severity of malaria. Chills and rigors are symptoms of malaria, but they do not indicate the severity of the disease. Low blood sugar can be a complication of malaria, but it is not a direct indicator of the severity of the disease. Urinalysis showing blood in urine can be a sign of malaria, but it is not a direct indicator of the severity of the disease. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  The Blantyre coma scale is a clinical tool used to assess the severity of malaria. It is used to assess the level of consciousness in a patient with malaria. A score of 4/5 indicates a severe level of malaria, which is life-threatening. The other options are not directly related to the severity of malaria.

###Options:
A.  Myocardial infraction
B.  Ascites
C.  Pneumonia
D.  Stroke
E.  . Head Injury

###Answer:","B.  Ascites

Rationale: Ascites is a condition where fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity. This fluid can contain D-xylose, which is then excreted in the urine, leading to a false positive result in the urinary D-xylose test. The test is used to assess the integrity of the intestinal mucosa in malabsorption syndromes. In this case, the presence of D-xylose in the urine is not due to malabsorption, but rather due to the presence of D-xylose in the ascitic fluid. Therefore, ascites will give a false positive result in the urinary D-xylose test. 

Note: The other options are not related to the urinary D-xylose test and are not relevant to the question. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the urinary D-xylose test and its limitations, as well as the ability to analyze the options and choose the correct answer. The correct answer is not a straightforward one, and the test-taker needs to think critically to arrive at the correct answer. 

This type of question is appropriate for assessing the test-taker's ability to think critically and make informed decisions based on their knowledge of the subject matter. It is also a good example of a question that requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge in a practical scenario, rather than simply recalling facts. 

In terms of Bloom's Taxonomy, this question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge (Level 4) to a specific scenario, and to think critically about the options and choose the correct answer. It does not require the test-taker to remember facts (Level 1), understand concepts (Level 2), or analyze data (Level 3). 

Therefore, this question is a good example of a question that requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge and think critically, rather than simply recalling facts. 

This type of question is also a good example of a question that requires the test-taker to have a deep understanding of the subject matter, rather than just a surface-level understanding.

###Options:
A.  H+, K+ ATPase
B.  Acetylcholine receptors
C.  gastrin receptors
D.  prostaglandin receptors
E.  Histamine receptors.

###Answer:","A.  H+, K+ ATPase

Rationale: Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease that results from the body's immune system attacking the parietal cells in the stomach. The parietal cells are responsible for secreting intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. The autoantibodies in pernicious anemia are directed against the H+, K+ ATPase, which is a proton pump that is involved in the secretion of gastric acid. The presence of anti-parietal cell antibodies is a diagnostic marker for pernicious anemia. Therefore, the correct answer is A. H+, K+ ATPase. 

Note: The other options are not correct because acetylcholine receptors are involved in the transmission of nerve impulses, gastrin receptors are involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion, prostaglandin receptors are involved in the regulation of inflammation, and histamine receptors are involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. None of these are directly related to the pathogenesis of pernicious anemia.

###Options:
A.  Iron
B.  Digoxin
C.  Ampicillin
D.  Ketoconazole
E.  None of the above

###Answer:","B

Rationale: 
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This action results in a significant reduction in gastric acidity. The absorption of many drugs is affected by the reduction in gastric acidity. However, the absorption of digoxin is not affected by PPIs. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is absorbed in the small intestine. The pH of the small intestine is not significantly affected by PPIs, and therefore, the absorption of digoxin is not affected. The absorption of iron, ampicillin, and ketoconazole is affected by PPIs. Iron absorption is reduced by PPIs because iron is poorly soluble at low pH. Ampicillin absorption is reduced by PPIs because ampicillin is a weak acid that is poorly soluble at low pH. Ketoconazole absorption is reduced by PPIs because ketoconazole is a weak base that is poorly soluble at low pH. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Digoxin. 

Explanation: 
The absorption of many drugs is affected by the reduction in gastric acidity caused by PPIs. However, the absorption of digoxin is not affected by PPIs. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is absorbed in the small intestine. The pH of the small intestine is not significantly affected by PPIs, and therefore, the absorption of digoxin is not affected. The absorption of iron, ampicillin, and ketoconazole is affected by PPIs. Iron absorption is reduced by PPIs because iron is poorly soluble at low pH. Ampicillin absorption is reduced by PPIs because ampicillin is a weak acid that is poorly soluble at low pH. Ketoconazole absorption is reduced by PPIs because ketoconazole is a weak base that is poorly soluble at low pH. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Digoxin. 

Note: 
The question is asking about the absorption of medications, not their efficacy or safety. The correct answer is B. Digoxin, because the absorption of digoxin is not affected by PPIs. The other options are incorrect because the absorption of iron, ampicillin, and ketoconazole is affected by PPIs.

Rationale: The pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is due to the hypersensitivity response to its products. The bacteria cause a strong cell-mediated immune response, which leads to the formation of granulomas. The granulomas are collections of immune cells that attempt to wall off the bacteria. However, the bacteria can survive within the granulomas, and the immune response can cause damage to the surrounding tissue. The caseous necrosis is a result of the immune response, not the cause of the pathogenicity. The impaired antibody response and cell-mediated response are not the cause of the pathogenicity, but rather the result of the infection. The direct host cell killing by the bacillus is not the primary mechanism of pathogenicity. The expanding granuloma is a result of the immune response, not the cause of the pathogenicity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. hypersensitivity response to products of TB bacteria. 

Note: The question is designed to test the understanding of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The correct answer requires an understanding of the immune response and the mechanisms of pathogenicity. The incorrect options are designed to test the ability to eliminate incorrect information and choose the correct answer.

###Options:
A.  Displacement
B.  Replacement
C.  Suppression
D.  Repression
E.  Expression

###Answer:","C.  Suppression

Rationale: Suppression is the process of pushing an unacceptable thought or feeling into the unconscious mind. In this scenario, George was upset but did not react to his coach's shouting. This suggests that he suppressed his anger. However, when he got home and his cat came rubbing itself at his feet, he angrily kicked the cat. This indicates that the suppressed anger was later expressed. Therefore, George is employing suppression.  Displacement is the process of redirecting an unacceptable feeling to a more acceptable target. In this scenario, George's anger was directed at his cat, not his coach.  Replacement is the process of replacing an unacceptable feeling with a more acceptable one. In this scenario, George's anger was not replaced with a more acceptable feeling.  Repression is the process of pushing an unacceptable thought or feeling into the unconscious mind and forgetting it. In this scenario, George did not forget his anger.  Expression is the process of openly showing an emotion. In this scenario, George's anger was not openly shown.  Therefore, the correct answer is suppression.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7579861,0.8467319,0.79990506

###Question:  Mycobacteria Tuberculosis
###Options:
A.  Are aerobic, non-spore forming , non-motile cocci
B.  Induce type 2 hypersensitivity
C.  Cause formation of epithelioid cell granulomas
D.  Are killed by macrophages in primary infection
E.  Are killed by macrophages in primary infection

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Mycobacteria tuberculosis is a type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis (TB). It is a type of acid-fast bacillus (AFB) that is known to cause granulomatous disease. The granulomas are formed by the body's immune response to the bacteria, and they are composed of epithelioid cells, which are a type of macrophage that has engulfed the bacteria. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Options A and D are incorrect because Mycobacteria tuberculosis is a type of rod-shaped bacteria, not a coccus, and it is not killed by macrophages in primary infection. Option B is incorrect because Mycobacteria tuberculosis induces type 4 hypersensitivity, not type 2 hypersensitivity. Option E is a duplicate of option D.  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The life cycle of Plasmodium species involves two hosts: the human host and the mosquito vector. In the human host, the parasite undergoes asexual reproduction in the liver (hepatic stage) and in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic stage). In the erythrocytic stage, the parasite matures and multiplies within the red blood cells (RBCs). Therefore, option C is correct. Option A is incorrect because Plasmodium vivax is associated with mild anemia, not severe anemia. Option B is incorrect because sporozoites initially invade liver cells, not the spleen. Option D is incorrect because Plasmodium falciparum infection initially causes symptoms such as fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms, but not hepatomegaly.

###Question: Night blindness is caused by deficiency  of 

###Options:
A.  vitamin b
B.  vitamin c
C.  vitamin a
D.  vitamin e
E.  vitamin d

###Answer:","C.  vitamin a

Rationale: Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. A deficiency in vitamin A can cause night blindness, which is the inability to see in low light conditions. This is because vitamin A is necessary for the production of rhodopsin, a protein in the retina that helps the eye to adjust to changes in light levels. Without sufficient vitamin A, the eye is unable to adapt to low light conditions, leading to night blindness. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are incorrect because vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin D are not directly related to night blindness. While these vitamins are important for overall health, they do not play a specific role in maintaining the health of the retina or preventing night blindness. 

This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the relationship between vitamin A and night blindness, as well as the ability to eliminate incorrect options based on their understanding of the topic. The correct answer is based on scientific evidence and is a well-established fact in the field of nutrition and ophthalmology. 

In terms of Bloom's Taxonomy, this question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of the topic to a specific scenario, which is a key aspect of the ""Application"" level of the taxonomy. The test-taker must use their understanding of the relationship between vitamin A and night blindness to select the correct answer, demonstrating their ability to apply their knowledge in a practical way. 

This type of question is also relevant to the topic of nutrition and health, which is a key aspect of the subject matter. The question requires the test-taker to think critically about the relationship between nutrition and health, and to apply their knowledge of the topic to a specific scenario. This type of question is therefore an effective way to assess the test-taker's understanding of the topic and their ability to apply their knowledge in a practical way.

D.  0, 7, 14, 28
E.  0, 7, 28

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The correct answer is C. days 0, 14. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for rabies is given to individuals who are at high risk of exposure to the virus, such as laboratory workers, veterinarians, and travelers to areas where rabies is common. The PrEP regimen consists of two doses of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) and a series of 2-3 doses of rabies vaccine, given on days 0 and 7. The vaccine is given on days 0 and 7, and the RIG is given on day 0. The second dose of RIG is not given. Therefore, the correct answer is C. days 0, 14.  The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the PrEP regimen for rabies. Option A includes a dose on day 28, which is not part of the PrEP regimen. Option B includes a dose on day 28, which is not part of the PrEP regimen. Option D includes a dose on day 28, which is not part of the PrEP regimen. Option E includes a dose on day 28, which is not part of the PrEP regimen.  Therefore, the correct answer is C. days 0, 14.  The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the PrEP regimen for rabies. Option A includes a dose on day 28, which is not part of the PrEP regimen.

###Options:
A.  Tinea corporis
B.  lichen Planus
C.  Granuloma Annulare
D.  Borderline leprosy
E.  Lupus vulgaris

###Answer:","E.  Lupus vulgaris

Rationale: The description of the plaque is suggestive of lupus vulgaris, which is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis. The gradual progression of the plaque, its annular shape, crusting, induration, and scarring in the center are all characteristic features of lupus vulgaris. The other options are not consistent with the description provided. Tinea corporis is a fungal infection that typically presents with a well-defined, round or oval plaque with a clear center, but it does not usually have the same level of induration and scarring as lupus vulgaris. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can present with flat-topped papules and plaques, but it does not typically have the same level of crusting and scarring as lupus vulgaris. Granuloma annulare is a benign skin condition that typically presents with small, round or oval papules arranged in a ring-like pattern, but it does not usually have the same level of induration and scarring as lupus vulgaris. Borderline leprosy is a form of leprosy that is characterized by a mixture of tuberculoid and lepromatous features, but it does not typically present with the same level of crusting and scarring as lupus vulgaris. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is lupus vulgaris. 

Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the description of the clinical presentation. The correct answer requires an understanding of the characteristic features of lupus vulgaris and the ability to distinguish it from other skin conditions. 

Additional note: The question is self-contained and does not require any external information or references to answer. The answer can be determined based solely on the description of the clinical presentation. 

Additional note: The question is designed to test the ability to apply knowledge of dermatology to a specific clinical scenario. The correct answer requires an understanding of the characteristic features of lupus vulgaris and the ability to distinguish it from other skin conditions.

###Options:
A.  Respiratory failure
B.  Uremia
C.  Severe Heart failure
D.  Inflammatory bowel disease
E.  Phenytoin therapy

###Answer:","C.  Severe Heart failure

Rationale: 
Asterixis, also known as ""liver flap,"" is a clinical sign of hepatic encephalopathy. It is characterized by a flapping tremor of the hands. The causes of asterixis are multifactorial and include metabolic disturbances, electrolyte imbalances, and medications. Severe heart failure is not a known cause of asterixis. The other options are all known causes of asterixis. Uremia, for example, is a known cause of asterixis in patients with end-stage renal disease. Phenytoin therapy can also cause asterixis as a side effect. Inflammatory bowel disease can lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, which can contribute to the development of asterixis. Respiratory failure can lead to hypoxia, which can cause asterixis. Therefore, severe heart failure is the correct answer. 

Note: 
The question is asking for the option that is NOT a known cause of asterixis. The other options are all known causes of asterixis. The correct answer is the option that is not associated with asterixis. 

Additional Information: 
Asterixis is a clinical sign of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. It is characterized by a flapping tremor of the hands.

###Question: 50-year-old male is diagnosed of liver disease after routine screening. which of the following laboratory parameters will help distinguish acute from chronic liver disease. 
###Options:
A.  AST
B.  Alkaline phosphatase
C.  Albumin
D.  Bilirubin
E.  ALT

###Answer:","C.  Albumin

Rationale: 
Albumin is a protein produced by the liver. In chronic liver disease, the liver is able to produce albumin for a longer period of time, so the levels of albumin remain normal. In acute liver disease, the liver is unable to produce albumin, so the levels of albumin are low. Therefore, low albumin levels are indicative of acute liver disease. 

Note: 
The other options are not correct because AST, alkaline phosphatase, and ALT are enzymes that are elevated in both acute and chronic liver disease. Bilirubin is also elevated in both acute and chronic liver disease. Therefore, these parameters are not helpful in distinguishing between acute and chronic liver disease.  End of Note.

###Options:
A.  Wegener’s granulomatosis
B.  Acute Lymphocytic leukemia
C.  Turners syndrome
D.  Pulmonary embolism

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Strawberry gums are a classic sign of Wegener’s granulomatosis, a form of vasculitis that affects small to medium-sized vessels. The condition is characterized by the presence of granulomas in the respiratory tract and kidneys. The presence of strawberry gums is due to the infiltration of the gums by the same granulomatous process that affects the lungs. The patient’s hemoptysis is likely due to the granulomatous inflammation of the lung tissue. The other options are not associated with strawberry gums. Turner’s syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, characterized by short stature, infertility, and heart defects. Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of an artery in the lungs, usually due to a blood clot. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Pulmonary tuberculosis is an infection of the lungs caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. None of these conditions are associated with strawberry gums.

###Answer:","C.  Lyssa virus

Rationale: Lyssa virus is not an Arbovirus commonly spread by the Aedes Mosquitoes. Lyssa virus is a rabies virus, which is primarily spread through the saliva of infected animals, usually through a bite. The other options are all Arboviruses that are commonly spread by the Aedes Mosquitoes. Zika virus, chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus are all transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Lyssa virus. 

Note: Arboviruses are a group of viruses that are transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected arthropod, such as a mosquito or tick. The term ""Arbovirus"" is an acronym for ""arthropod-borne virus."" The Aedes mosquito is a common vector for many Arboviruses, including the ones listed in the options. 

Additional Information: The Aedes mosquito is a primary vector for many Arboviruses, including Zika virus, chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus.

E.  Quinine is the first-line drug of choice in uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The life cycle of Plasmodium species involves two hosts: the human and the mosquito. The parasite undergoes asexual reproduction in the human host, leading to the development of clinical symptoms. In the case of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, the parasite can remain dormant in the liver cells (hepatic parenchymal cells) for months or even years, a phenomenon known as hypnozoite persistence. This dormant stage can reactivate, leading to clinical relapse. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The other options are incorrect: A is incorrect because clinical symptoms begin when the parasite sporozoites invade red blood cells, not hepatic parenchymal cells. C is incorrect because relapse in P. vivax and P. ovale is due to the reactivation of hypnozoites in the liver, not due to new merozoites released during the erythrocytic phase. D is incorrect because it is not a well-established fact that only 52% of P. vivax are evident within a month.

###Answer:","A. Leprosy

Rationale: Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a long-term infection by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Early symptoms may include a skin rash, and discoloration of the skin. The disease primarily affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Leprosy is a chronic infection that can cause nerve damage and disfigurement. It is not highly contagious and is usually spread through respiratory droplets. Leprosy is a significant public health problem in some parts of the world, particularly in tropical regions. The disease is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, and other tissues. Leprosy is also known as Hansen's disease, named after the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, who first identified the bacteria that cause the disease in 1873. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Leprosy.  The other options are incorrect because tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs, Yaws is a tropical disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, Bubonic Plague is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lymph nodes, and Lichen Planus is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes.  These diseases are not related to Hansen's disease.  Therefore, the correct answer is A. Leprosy.  The other options are incorrect because tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs, Yaws is a tropical disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, Bubonic Plague is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lymph nodes, and Lichen Planus is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes.

###Options:
A.  Zone 1
B.  Zone 2
C.  Zone 3
D.  None of the above
E.  All of the above

###Answer:","B.  Zone 2

Rationale: Yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus which is hepatotropic and is transmitted by mosquitoes, belonging to the Aedes species. The virus primarily affects the zone 2 of the hepatic acinus, which is the area of the liver where the blood is rich in oxygen and nutrients. This is the area where the virus causes the most damage, leading to the characteristic symptoms of yellow fever, such as jaundice and liver failure. Zone 1 is the area where the blood is rich in oxygen and nutrients, but it is not the primary site of infection. Zone 3 is the area where the blood is rich in oxygen, but it is not the primary site of infection. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Zone 2. 

Note: The hepatic acinus is the functional unit of the liver, and it is divided into three zones: zone 1 (periportal zone), zone 2 (mid-zonal zone), and zone 3 (pericentral zone). Each zone has a different blood supply and function. Zone 1 is the area where the blood is rich in oxygen and nutrients, zone 2 is the area where the blood is rich in oxygen and nutrients, and zone 3 is the area where the blood is rich in oxygen. The yellow fever virus primarily affects zone 2 of the hepatic acinus.

###Question: Orbicularis Oculi paresis with lagophthalmos and an insensitive cornea frequently leads to blindness in patients with:

###Options:
A.  Leprosy
B.  vitamin A deficiency
C.  Diabetes
D.  Trachoma
E.  Graves Disease

###Answer:","A

Rationale: The orbicularis oculi muscle is responsible for closing the eyelids. Paresis of this muscle, along with lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely), can lead to exposure of the cornea, which can cause corneal ulcers and subsequent blindness. Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection that can cause peripheral neuropathy, including facial nerve palsy, which can lead to orbicularis oculi paresis. Leprosy can also cause sensory loss, leading to an insensitive cornea. Therefore, the combination of orbicularis oculi paresis, lagophthalmos, and an insensitive cornea is a classic triad associated with leprosy. The other options are not directly associated with this specific combination of symptoms. Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness, but not the specific combination of symptoms described. Diabetes can cause a variety of eye problems, including diabetic retinopathy, but not the specific combination of symptoms described. Trachoma is a bacterial infection that can cause blindness, but it is not typically associated with orbicularis oculi paresis or an insensitive cornea. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that can cause eye problems, including exophthalmos, but not the specific combination of symptoms described. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

C.  they cause severe disease after infection with only a few parasites
D.  they typically cause lifelong infections
E.  Schistosoma is a helminth which affects humans.

###Answer:","D.  they typically cause lifelong infections

Rationale: Helminths are a group of parasites that are typically characterized by their ability to cause lifelong infections in their hosts. This is because they often have complex life cycles that involve multiple hosts, and they can survive for extended periods of time in the human body. In fact, some helminths, such as tapeworms and hookworms, can live in the human body for many years, even decades, without causing significant harm. This is in contrast to other types of parasites, such as protozoa, which typically cause acute infections that are resolved by the host's immune system. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. 

Note: The other options are incorrect because helminths do multiply in the host (A), they often provoke eosinophilia (B), they can cause severe disease after infection with a large number of parasites (C), and Schistosoma is indeed a helminth that affects humans (E). However, option D is the most characteristic feature of helminths that infect human beings.

###Options:
A.  5 years
B.  5-10 years
C.  less than 5 years
D.  10 years
E.  More than 10 years

###Answer:","E.  More than 10 years

Rationale: The elimination of onchocerciasis from a designated region requires a sustained vector control effort for more than 10 years. This is because the microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus can survive for up to 14 years in the human host, and the vector, Simulium spp., can continue to transmit the infection during this period. Therefore, a prolonged vector control effort is necessary to break the transmission cycle and eliminate the disease from the region. 

Note: The other options are incorrect because they underestimate the duration of vector control required to eliminate onchocerciasis. A 5-year or 10-year effort may not be sufficient to break the transmission cycle, and a less than 5-year effort is unlikely to be effective. 

This question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of the biology of onchocerciasis and the principles of disease elimination to arrive at the correct answer. It assesses their ability to think critically and make informed decisions based on scientific evidence.

###Options:
A.  Scabies
B.  Stevens Johnson’s Syndrome
C.  infantile eczema

###Answer:","A. Scabies

Rationale: The clinical presentation of the infant with multiple papules and exudative lesions on the face, scalp, trunk, and few vesicles on the palms and soles, along with the mother's history of itchy lesions, is highly suggestive of scabies. Scabies is a parasitic infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which burrows into the skin and causes intense itching, particularly at night. The presence of lesions on the palms and soles is a characteristic feature of scabies in infants, as they are unable to scratch the affected areas effectively. The mother's history of itchy lesions further supports the diagnosis, as scabies is highly contagious and can be transmitted through close contact with an infected individual. The other options, such as Stevens-Johnson's Syndrome, infantile eczema, infantile seborrheic dermatitis, and impetigo contagiosa, do not match the clinical presentation and history provided.

D.  If greater than 72 hours immunoglobulin should be given IM
E.  unimmunized contacts houd be given MMR within 72 hours if over 6 months of age

###Answer:","D.  If greater than 72 hours immunoglobulin should be given IM

Rationale: 
The correct answer is D. If greater than 72 hours immunoglobulin should be given IM. Immunoglobulin should be given within 72 hours of exposure to prevent measles. If given after 72 hours, it is not effective. It should be given IM, not SC. The other options are true statements about measles. Koplick’s spots are seen a few days after the onset of rash (A). The rash appears a few days after the prodrome, starting at the head and moving caudad (B). Unimmunized contacts should be excluded from school for 2 weeks (C). Unimmunized contacts should be given MMR within 72 hours if over 6 months of age (E). 

Explanation: 
Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that is characterized by a prodrome of fever, cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis, followed by a rash that appears a few days later. Koplick’s spots are small, white spots that appear on the buccal mucosa a few days after the onset of rash. The rash of measles appears at the head and moves caudad. Unimmunized contacts should be excluded from school for 2 weeks to prevent the spread of the disease. Immunoglobulin should be given within 72 hours of exposure to prevent measles. If given after 72 hours, it is not effective. It should be given IM, not SC. Unimmunized contacts should be given MMR within 72 hours if over 6 months of age. 

Note: 
This question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the characteristics of measles and the appropriate management of contacts. The correct answer is not true of measles, and the test-taker must be able to identify the incorrect statement.

C.  Pre and post test counselling for HIV serology is now no longer mandatory
D.  Pneumococcus is a more likely pathogen than Tb in AIDS patient with pneumonia
E.  Toxoplasma typically causes retinitis

###Answer:","B
Rationale: A CD4 count of  1.0 x 10^9/L is associated with late stage AIDS. The CD4 count is a measure of the number of CD4 T cells in the blood. In HIV infection, the CD4 count decreases as the virus destroys these cells. A CD4 count of 200 cells per cubic millimeter (mm^3) or less is generally considered a sign of AIDS. However, the exact CD4 count that indicates AIDS can vary depending on the individual and the specific circumstances. In general, a CD4 count of 1.0 x 10^9/L is considered a very low count and is associated with late-stage AIDS. This is because the immune system is severely compromised, and the individual is at high risk of opportunistic infections and other complications. The other options are incorrect because shingles, seborrheic dermatitis, and recurrent HSV infections are not typical of early HIV infection (A); pre and post-test counseling for HIV serology is still mandatory (C); pneumococcus is not a more likely pathogen than TB in AIDS patients with pneumonia (D); and toxoplasma typically causes encephalitis, not retinitis (E).  Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can cause encephalitis in people with HIV/AIDS. It is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. While toxoplasmosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, and confusion, it typically causes encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain. Retinitis is a different condition that is caused by the CMV virus, not toxoplasmosis. CMV retinitis is a serious eye infection that can cause blindness in people with HIV/AIDS. It is characterized by inflammation of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. CMV retinitis is a common complication of HIV/AIDS, especially in people with advanced disease. It is often treated with antiviral medications. In summary, toxoplasmosis typically causes encephalitis, not retinitis, in people with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, option E is incorrect.  In summary, a CD4 count of  1.0 x 10^9/L is associated with late-stage AIDS. The other options are incorrect because shingles, seborrheic",B,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7085618,0.8628287,0.7781229

Rationale: Tetanus is caused by the exotoxin of Clostridium tetani. The toxin causes muscle rigidity, which can manifest as rigidity of muscles in close proximity to the initial injury. The incubation period of tetanus is usually long, and a short incubation period is associated with a worse prognosis. Tetanus can affect the autonomic nervous system, leading to symptoms such as hypertension, tachycardia, and pupillary dilation.

###Question: Which animal is least associated with rabies?

###Options:
A.  skunks
B.  rabbits
C.  red fox
D.  bats
E.  dogs

###Answer:","B.  rabbits

Rationale: Rabies is a viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals. It is primarily transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, usually through a bite. While various animals can carry and transmit rabies, some are more commonly associated with the disease than others. Rabbits are generally considered to be one of the least associated animals with rabies. Rabbits are not typically aggressive and are not known to carry the virus as frequently as other animals. They are also not as likely to bite, which is the primary mode of rabies transmission. In contrast, animals like bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and dogs are more commonly associated with rabies due to their behavior, habitat, and the frequency of reported cases. Therefore, the correct answer is B. rabbits. 

Note: The question is asking for the animal that is least associated with rabies, which means we are looking for the animal that is least likely to carry or transmit the disease. The options provided include various animals that are commonly associated with rabies, and we need to identify the one that stands out as being less associated with the disease. 

Additional Information: Rabies is a serious viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals. It is primarily transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, usually through a bite. The virus attacks the central nervous system, causing inflammation of the brain and eventually leading to death if left untreated. Rabies is almost always fatal if symptoms appear, but prompt medical attention can prevent the disease if administered before symptoms develop. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent rabies, and it is typically administered to animals that are at high risk of exposure, such as dogs and cats. In addition to vaccination, avoiding contact with wild animals and not handling animals that may be infected with rabies can also help prevent the disease. 

Note: The additional information provided is not necessary to answer the question but provides context and background information about rabies. It can be useful for further understanding the topic and may be relevant for other questions or discussions.

###Answer:","C.  bite on extremity

Rationale: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies is recommended for individuals who have been bitten or exposed to the saliva of a potentially rabid animal. The risk of rabies transmission is higher if the bite is on the face or neck, as the virus can more easily enter the central nervous system through these areas. Bites on extremities are considered low-risk and do not typically require PEP. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because they all represent high-risk exposures that require PEP. A scratch can be considered a low-risk exposure, but it is not the best answer choice in this case. Bites on the face (option B) and mucous membrane exposure to a bat (option D) are both high-risk exposures that require PEP.

C.  p falciparum
D.  p. ovale
E.  none of them

###Answer:","C.  p falciparum

Rationale: P. falciparum is the least likely to show periodicity of fever in malaria. This is because P. falciparum has a shorter incubation period and a higher parasitemia level, which can lead to a more continuous and severe fever pattern. In contrast, the other options (P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale) typically exhibit periodic fever patterns due to their longer incubation periods and lower parasitemia levels. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. 

Note: The question is designed to test the ability to identify the least likely organism to show periodicity of fever in malaria, which requires an understanding of the characteristics of different Plasmodium species. The correct answer, P. falciparum, is the one that is least likely to exhibit periodic fever patterns.

C.  The provision of HIV testing kits is a priority for good case management
D.  Infection rates are generally higher in rural populations.
E.  Prevention of Mother-to-child transmission programs have been ineffective in disease control.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Circumcision has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This is because the foreskin is a common site of HIV entry into the body. In Africa, where circumcision is traditionally practiced, the procedure has been shown to be effective in reducing HIV transmission. This is why option A is correct. Option B is incorrect because Pneumocystis pneumonia is a common presentation of AIDS in Europe, not Africa. Option C is incorrect because HIV testing kits are not a priority for good case management. Option D is incorrect because infection rates are generally higher in urban populations, not rural populations. Option E is incorrect because prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs have been effective in disease control. These programs have been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child by approximately 70%.  Therefore, option A is the correct answer.  The rationale for this answer is that circumcision has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This is because the foreskin is a common site of HIV entry into the body.

###Options:
A.  Amoebiasis
B.  Schistosomiasis
C.  Trypanosomiasis
D.  Toxocariasis
E.  Stongyloidiasis

###Answer:","B.  Schistosomiasis

Rationale: Praziquantel is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug that is effective against a wide range of flatworms, including schistosomes. It is the drug of choice for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a disease caused by infection with one of the five species of Schistosoma. Praziquantel works by causing the death of the schistosomes, and it is usually given orally. It is also used to treat other types of flatworm infections, such as liver fluke and lung fluke infections. However, it is not effective against roundworms or hookworms, which are types of nematode worms. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because praziquantel is not used to treat amoebiasis, trypanosomiasis, toxocariasis, or strongyloidiasis.

E.  There is no vaccine for yellow fever

###Answer:","D.  Is caused by an arbovirus

Rationale: Yellow fever is caused by an arbovirus, which is a type of virus that is transmitted by arthropods, such as mosquitoes. The virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected female Aedes mosquito, which is the primary vector of the disease. The incubation period of yellow fever is typically 3-6 days, and the disease can cause severe symptoms, including fever, chills, and hemorrhaging. There is a vaccine available for yellow fever, which is recommended for travelers to certain parts of Africa and South America where the disease is endemic. Therefore, option E is incorrect. Options B and C are also incorrect because strict isolation of cases is not an effective method for controlling yellow fever epidemics, and the disease is primarily spread by Aedes mosquitoes, not anopheline mosquitoes.

###Question: 
44. Which of the following is a severe feature of P. Falciparum malaria
###Options:
A.  metabolic acidosis
B.  metabolic alkalosis
C.  chronic kidney disease
D.  hyperglycemia

###Answer:","A.  metabolic acidosis

Rationale: 
P. Falciparum malaria is a severe form of malaria that can cause various complications, including metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is a condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of acid in the body, which can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. In the context of P. Falciparum malaria, metabolic acidosis can occur due to the parasite's ability to consume glucose and produce lactic acid, leading to a decrease in blood pH. This can cause symptoms such as rapid breathing, confusion, and even coma in severe cases. Therefore, metabolic acidosis is a severe feature of P. Falciparum malaria. 

The other options are incorrect because:
- Metabolic alkalosis is a condition characterized by an excessive loss of acid in the body, which is not typically associated with P. Falciparum malaria.
- Chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition that can be caused by various factors, including diabetes and high blood pressure, but it is not a direct feature of P. Falciparum malaria.
- Hyperglycemia is a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can occur in various conditions, including diabetes, but it is not a severe feature of P. Falciparum malaria.

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Acute schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama fever, is a condition that occurs when the body's immune system reacts to the presence of schistosomes. The symptoms of acute schistosomiasis include fever, chills, cough, and muscle aches. Eosinophilia is a common feature of acute schistosomiasis, as the body's immune system responds to the presence of the parasites. The other options are not typical characteristics of acute schistosomiasis. Paraparesis is a condition characterized by weakness or paralysis of the legs, which is not typically associated with acute schistosomiasis. Convulsions are not a common symptom of acute schistosomiasis. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is not typically associated with acute schistosomiasis. Hematochezia, or bloody stools, is not a typical symptom of acute schistosomiasis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. eosinophilia.

Rationale: The correct answer is D. Vibrio cholerae of the 01 serotype is the only cause of clinical disease. The 01 serotype of Vibrio cholerae is the only serotype that causes clinical disease. The other serotypes are non-pathogenic. The 01 serotype produces cholera toxin, which causes the disease cholera. The toxin is a potent enterotoxin that causes a massive increase in the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, leading to the characteristic symptom of profuse watery diarrhea. The other options are incorrect. A. Low gastric pH does not protect against infection. In fact, the bacteria can survive in the acidic environment of the stomach. B. Cholera toxin produces its effect by increasing intracellular levels of cAMP, not reducing them. C. Fever is not usual in adults. D.

Mosquitoes are the primary vectors for these diseases, transmitting them through bites. The other options are incorrect because mosquitoes are not the primary vectors for visceral leishmaniasis (B), myiasis (C), or sporotrichosis (E). Visceral leishmaniasis is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly, myiasis is caused by the larvae of flies, and sporotrichosis is caused by a fungus that enters the body through cuts or abrasions in the skin.

B.  Can effectively be treated using mepacrine
C.  Cysts survive in water boiled for ten minutes
D.  Trophozoites have four flagella
E.  Is a fluke

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis. The trophozoites of Giardia lamblia have four pairs of flagella. The cysts of Giardia lamblia are the infective form and are resistant to environmental factors. The cysts can survive in water boiled for ten minutes. Giardia lamblia is usually acquired by ingestion of food and water contaminated by the cysts. The cysts are not affected by boiling water. Mepacrine is not used to treat giardiasis. Giardia lamblia is not a fluke. It is a protozoan parasite. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect.  Option A is incorrect because the cysts are the infective form of Giardia lamblia. Option B is incorrect because mepacrine is not used to treat giardiasis. Option C is incorrect because the cysts are not affected by boiling water. Option E is incorrect because Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite, not a fluke.  Therefore, option D is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect.  Option A is incorrect because the cysts are the infective form of Giardia lamblia.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Eosinophilia is a condition characterized by an elevated number of eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in fighting parasitic infections and in allergic reactions. The options listed are all recognized causes of eosinophilia, except for malaria. Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium species, but it typically causes anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, rather than eosinophilia. In fact, malaria can sometimes cause a decrease in eosinophil count. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae, a gram-negative bacterium. The treatment of cholera involves the use of antibiotics such as doxycycline or ciprofloxacin to eliminate the bacteria from the body. However, the primary treatment of cholera is fluid replacement to prevent dehydration. Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against Vibrio cholerae. Penicillin is not effective against gram-negative bacteria, and the other options are not relevant to the treatment of cholera. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Doxycycline.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Hepatitis B is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is due to the high prevalence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the region, which is often acquired perinatally or through vertical transmission from mother to child. The high prevalence of HBV infection is attributed to factors such as poor sanitation, lack of access to healthcare, and cultural practices that increase the risk of transmission. As a result, HBV-related liver disease is a significant public health concern in Sub-Saharan Africa, and efforts to prevent and treat HBV infection are essential to reduce the burden of liver disease in the region.

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Pulmonary tuberculosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals in Africa. The prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis is high in many African countries, and the two diseases often coexist. In fact, in some African countries, the majority of HIV-infected individuals also have tuberculosis. The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the need for integrated HIV and tuberculosis control programs in these settings. Therefore, option E is the correct answer. Options A, B, C, and D are incorrect because circumcision is not a proven method for preventing HIV infection, infection rates are generally higher in urban populations, pneumocystis pneumonia is not a more common presentation of AIDS in Africa, and the provision of HIV testing kits is not a priority for good case management.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: The Gambian form of African trypanosomiasis progresses more rapidly than the Rhodesian form. The Rhodesian form is associated with a more prolonged incubation period and a more chronic course. The Gambian form is associated with a more acute course and a shorter incubation period. The Rhodesian form is also associated with a more prominent chancre. Pentamidine is used to treat the Gambian form of African trypanosomiasis. Erythema chronicum migrans is a rash associated with Lyme disease, not African trypanosomiasis. The incubation period of African trypanosomiasis is typically 2-3 weeks, not 4-6 months.  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.  Option B is incorrect because erythema chronicum migrans is associated with Lyme disease, not African trypanosomiasis. Option D is incorrect because the Rhodesian form is associated with a more prominent chancre, not the Gambian form. Option E is incorrect because pentamidine is used to treat the Gambian form, not the Rhodesian form.

###Answer:","B.  Stangulated inguinal hernia
Rationale: The commonest cause of intestinal obstruction in Nigeria is strangulated inguinal hernia. This is because of the high prevalence of inguinal hernias in the population, which is a result of the high incidence of obesity, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors. In addition, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria has led to an increased incidence of inguinal hernias, which can become strangulated and cause intestinal obstruction. Therefore, strangulated inguinal hernia is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in Nigeria.

It is caused by Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackie A24. The condition is also known in Nigeria as Apollo. The infection is highly contagious and spreads through direct contact with an infected person. It is also spread through contaminated water and fomites. The infection is self-limiting and resolves on its own within a week. However, it can cause significant morbidity due to its high contagiousness. The infection is more common in tropical regions and is a major public health concern in these areas. The infection can be prevented through good hygiene practices, such as washing hands regularly and avoiding direct contact with an infected person. Treatment for the infection is mainly supportive and involves the use of lubricating eye drops to relieve symptoms. In severe cases, antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent secondary bacterial infection.  Therefore, the correct answer is D.  d.	Coxsackie A24.  The other options are incorrect because while adenovirus can cause conjunctivitis, it is not the primary cause of acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Herpesvirus can cause other types of eye infections, but it is not associated with acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Enterovirus 70 is a correct answer, but the question asks for the other virus that causes the condition, which is Coxsackie A24. Reovirus is not associated with acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis.  Therefore, the correct answer is D.  d.	Coxsackie A24.  The other options are incorrect because while adenovirus can cause conjunctivitis, it is not the primary cause of acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Herpesvirus can cause other types of eye infections, but it is not associated with acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Enterovirus 70 is a correct answer, but the question asks for the other virus that causes the condition, which is Coxsackie A24. Reovirus is not associated with acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis.

B.  b.	Ebola virus disease
C.  c.	Dengue haemorrhagic fever
D.  d.	Marburg haemorrhagic fever
E.  e.	Yellow fever

###Answer:","E
Rationale: Arthropod-borne haemorrhagic fevers in Nigeria include Yellow fever, Lassa fever, and others. Yellow fever is caused by a flavivirus transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. It is endemic in Nigeria and can cause severe disease. Lassa fever is caused by a virus in the arenavirus family and is transmitted through contact with infected rodents or their urine and faeces. It is also endemic in Nigeria and can cause severe disease. Ebola virus disease and Marburg haemorrhagic fever are caused by filoviruses and are transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids. They are not typically considered arthropod-borne. Dengue haemorrhagic fever is caused by a flavivirus and is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, but it is not typically considered a haemorrhagic fever in the same category as the others listed. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Yellow fever.  Lassa fever is not arthropod-borne.  Ebola and Marburg are not arthropod-borne.  Dengue is arthropod-borne but not a haemorrhagic fever in the same category as the others listed.  Therefore, the correct answer is E. Yellow fever.  Lassa fever is not arthropod-borne.  Ebola and Marburg are not arthropod-borne.  Dengue is arthropod-borne but not a haemorrhagic fever in the same category as the others listed.  Therefore, the correct answer is E. Yellow fever.  Lassa fever is not arthropod-borne.  Ebola and Marburg are not arthropod-borne.  Dengue is arthropod-borne but not a haemorrhagic fever in the same category as the others listed.  Therefore, the correct answer is E. Yellow fever.  Lassa fever is not arthropod-borne.  Ebola and Marburg are not arthropod-borne.  Dengue is arthropod-borne but not a haemorrhagic fever in the same category as the others listed.  Therefore, the correct answer is E. Yellow fever.  Lassa fever is not arthropod-borne.

###Answer:","E
Rationale: The skin and subcutaneous tissue are often closed primarily in typhoid perforation. The wound is not left open for delayed closure as wound infection inevitably happens, leading to wound dehiscence. The other options are true in the treatment of typhoid perforation. The prognosis is poor if perforation occurs in the first week of typhoid fever. Vigorous resuscitation with intravenous fluids and antibiotics in an intensive care unit is the treatment of choice.

C.  There is very low or absent malarial antibody titers
D.  There is reduced serum IgM
E.  There is unfavorable response to prolonged anti-malarial drug therapy

###Answer:","B.  There is lymphocytic infiltration of hepatic sinusoids

Rationale: Tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS) is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the spleen in individuals living in areas where malaria is endemic. The condition is associated with a chronic, low-grade infection with Plasmodium species, particularly Plasmodium vivax. The spleen enlargement in TSS is due to lymphocytic infiltration of the hepatic sinusoids, which leads to the accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages in the spleen. This infiltration is a key feature of TSS and distinguishes it from other conditions that cause splenomegaly. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the pathophysiology of TSS. Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia is not a characteristic of TSS, and malarial antibody titers are typically elevated in individuals with TSS. The response to anti-malarial drug therapy is not unfavorable in TSS.  .

###Options:
A.  Addison’s disease
B.  SIADH
C.  Conn’s syndrome
D.  Cushing disease

###Answer:","A. Addison’s disease

Rationale: Addison’s disease is a rare endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and aldosterone. The symptoms of Addison’s disease include darkening of skin, especially in areas that are exposed to the sun, dizziness, and fainting. The patient’s recent vacation in Nigeria, a country in the tropics, may have exposed him to the sun, which could have exacerbated the skin darkening. The dull grey-brown patches in his mouth and palm of his hands are likely due to the increased melanin production. The darkening of previous scars is also a characteristic feature of Addison’s disease. The dizziness when rising from a seated position is likely due to the decreased aldosterone levels, which can lead to decreased blood volume and decreased blood pressure. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Addison’s disease.  The other options are not correct because SIADH is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and hyponatremia, but it does not typically present with skin darkening or dizziness. Conn’s syndrome is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia, but it does not typically present with skin darkening or dizziness. Cushing disease is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of cortisol, leading to weight gain, hypertension, and glucose intolerance, but it does not typically present with skin darkening or dizziness.  Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Addison’s disease.  The other options are not correct because SIADH is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and hyponatremia, but it does not typically present with skin darkening or dizziness.

C.  Fluids containing colloids are used for maintenance
D.  Urinary output does not affect the amount per day
E.  1.5 litres of 0.9% Saline is needed per day

###Answer:","A
Rationale: The insensible water loss is approximately 1.5 litres per day. This is the amount of water lost through the skin and respiratory tract. This is a normal and expected loss and does not require replacement. The other options are incorrect. Option B is incorrect because the daily potassium requirement is approximately 2-3 mmol/kg, so for a 70 kg man, this would be 140-210 mmol. Option C is incorrect because colloids are used for resuscitation, not maintenance. Option D is incorrect because urinary output does affect the amount of fluid per day. Option E is incorrect because 1.5 litres of 0.9% saline is not needed per day. The daily maintenance fluid requirement is approximately 30-40 mL/kg/hour, so for a 70 kg man, this would be 2.1-2.8 litres per day. This can be given as 0.9% saline. 1.5 litres of 0.9% saline would be approximately 67.5 mmol of sodium, which is less than the daily requirement.  The daily sodium requirement is approximately 1-2 mmol/kg, so for a 70 kg man, this would be 70-140 mmol.  Therefore, 1.5 litres of 0.9% saline would not meet the daily sodium requirement.  Therefore, option E is incorrect.  Therefore, the correct answer is option A.  The insensible water loss is approximately 1.5 litres per day.  This is the amount of water lost through the skin and respiratory tract.  This is a normal and expected loss and does not require replacement.  Therefore, option A is correct.  Therefore, the correct answer is option A.  The insensible water loss is approximately 1.5 litres per day.  This is the amount of water lost through the skin and respiratory tract.

C.  Extracellular water is 40% of body weight
D.  Total body water in the male is 60% of body weight
E.  Insensible water loss is 2000mls

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Total body water in the male is 60% of body weight. This is a general rule of thumb. The percentage of body weight that is water varies with age, sex, and body composition. In general, the percentage of body weight that is water is higher in children and lower in older adults. In the male, the percentage of body weight that is water is approximately 60%, while in the female, it is approximately 50%. This is because women generally have a higher percentage of body fat, which contains less water than lean body mass. In the tropics, the high ambient temperature and humidity can lead to increased water loss through sweating, which can result in dehydration if not adequately replaced. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of the total body water content in the male to manage fluid and electrolyte balance effectively in the tropics.

C.  16% of newborns weigh <2.5kg at birth
D.  Malaria is responsible for about 75% of childhood death
E.  Measle- Mumps-Rubella vaccine is administered at 18months

###Answer:","B
Rationale: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. This recommendation is based on the benefits of breastfeeding for infant health, including reduced risk of infections, improved cognitive development, and lower risk of chronic diseases later in life. Exclusive breastfeeding means that the infant receives only breast milk, without any additional foods or liquids, for the first six months. After six months, solid foods can be introduced, and breastfeeding can continue until the child is at least two years old. The other options are not accurate: neonatal conditions are not the leading causes of Under-Five mortality, malaria is not responsible for about 75% of childhood deaths, and the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine is typically administered at 9-12 months, not 18 months. Newborns who weigh less than 2.5 kg at birth are considered low birth weight, but this is not a specific percentage. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

###Options:
A.  Pneumonia
B.  Tetralogy of Fallot
C.  Bronchial asthma
D.  Transposition of Great Arteries
E.  Septicemia

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In children, the most common causes of CCF are infections such as pneumonia, which can lead to acute heart failure. Tetralogy of Fallot, bronchial asthma, and transposition of the great arteries are congenital heart diseases that can lead to CCF, but they are less common in Nigerian children. Septicemia is a systemic infection that can lead to CCF, but it is not as common as pneumonia in Nigerian children. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Pneumonia.  This is because pneumonia is a common cause of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children in Nigeria, and it can lead to acute heart failure due to the increased workload on the heart.  The other options are not as common causes of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease that can lead to CCF, but it is less common in Nigerian children. Bronchial asthma is a respiratory disease that can lead to CCF, but it is not as common as pneumonia in Nigerian children. Transposition of the great arteries is a congenital heart disease that can lead to CCF, but it is less common in Nigerian children. Septicemia is a systemic infection that can lead to CCF, but it is not as common as pneumonia in Nigerian children.  Therefore, the correct answer is A. Pneumonia.  This is because pneumonia is a common cause of congestive cardiac failure in Nigerian children. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children in Nigeria, and it can lead to acute heart failure due to the increased workload on the heart.

###Options:
A.  Hereditary elliptocytosis
B.  Pyruvate Kinase deficiency
C.  Beta Thalassaemia
D.  G6PD deficiency
E.  Vitamin K deficiency

###Answer:","D
Rationale: G6PD deficiency is a common cause of neonatal anemia in Nigeria. It is a genetic disorder that affects the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which helps protect red blood cells from damage. In Nigeria, G6PD deficiency is prevalent due to the high frequency of the G6PD A- variant, which is associated with a higher risk of hemolysis. Neonates with G6PD deficiency may present with jaundice, anemia, and other symptoms, making it an important consideration in the diagnosis and management of neonatal anemia in Nigeria. The other options are less common causes of neonatal anemia in Nigeria. Hereditary elliptocytosis and Pyruvate Kinase deficiency are rare genetic disorders that can cause anemia, but they are not as prevalent in Nigeria as G6PD deficiency. Beta Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production, but it is not as common in Nigeria as G6PD deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency can cause bleeding disorders, but it is not a common cause of anemia in Nigeria. Therefore, the correct answer is D. G6PD deficiency.  Note: The question is asking for the most common cause of neonatal anemia in Nigeria, and the answer is G6PD deficiency. The other options are less common causes of neonatal anemia in Nigeria.

B.  Choreoathetoid is the commonest type in Africa
C.  Predominant cause in Nigeria is congenital toxoplasmosis
D.  Cortical atrophy is the basic pathologic manifestation
E.  Mental retardation is a constant feature

###Answer:","A
Rationale: Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect movement, balance, and coordination. The causes of cerebral palsy can be prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal. In Africa, perinatal causes are more common than prenatal causes. Choreoathetoid cerebral palsy is the commonest type in Africa. The predominant cause of cerebral palsy in Nigeria is congenital rubella, not toxoplasmosis.

###Options:
A.  School age children are most at risk
B.  Cough and breathlessness are common manifestations
C.  Early gastric lavage is recommended
D.  Corticosteroid therapy is helpful
E.  Mental retardation is a risk factor

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Kerosene is a hydrocarbon that is commonly used as a fuel. Ingestion of kerosene can cause aspiration of the liquid into the lungs, leading to chemical pneumonitis. The symptoms of kerosene poisoning include cough, breathlessness, and chest pain. Gastric lavage is not recommended as it can cause aspiration of the liquid into the lungs. Corticosteroids are not helpful in the treatment of kerosene poisoning. Mental retardation is not a risk factor for kerosene poisoning. School age children are not at higher risk for kerosene poisoning compared to other age groups. Therefore, the correct option is B. Cough and breathlessness are common manifestations.  Note: The question is based on the topic of poisoning, which is a part of the topic of toxicology. The question requires the test-taker to have knowledge of the symptoms and treatment of kerosene poisoning. The correct option is B, which is a common manifestation of kerosene poisoning.

D.  There is reduced CSF production.
E.  Elevated protein is due to destruction of organisms.

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Chronic otalgia is a risk factor for pyogenic meningitis. This is because the Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. If the Eustachian tube is blocked, it can lead to accumulation of bacteria in the middle ear, which can then spread to the meninges. This is known as otogenic meningitis. The other options are not correct. Haematogenous spread is one of the sources of infection, but not the only one. Staphylococcus species are not the commonest aetiology. Elevated protein in the CSF is due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier, not destruction of organisms. Reduced CSF production is not a characteristic of pyogenic meningitis.  The correct answer is C.  Chronic otalgia is a risk factor.  This is because the Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx.

Rationale: The child is presenting with signs of meningismus (inability to open the mouth, generalized body stiffness, board-like abdominal rigidity, and a mask-like expressionless face) which are suggestive of meningitis. The Glasgow Coma Score of 4/15 is also indicative of severe neurological impairment. The history of lack of immunization (A) is relevant as it increases the risk of meningitis. Board-like abdominal rigidity (B) and mask-like expressionless face (C) are also relevant signs of meningismus. However, suppurative ear discharge (D) is more suggestive of otitis media or mastoiditis, which can also present with signs of meningismus, but it is not directly related to the child's inability to open the mouth and generalized body stiffness. Therefore, it is not useful in the evaluation of the child's current presentation.  The Glasgow Coma Score of 4/15 (E) is a useful indicator of the severity of the child's condition.

Rationale: The exanthematous stage of measles is characterized by the appearance of a morbilliform rash, which is a key diagnostic feature of the disease. The rash typically starts on the face and spreads to other parts of the body, including the trunk, arms, and legs. It is accompanied by fever, cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis. Koplik’s spots are a characteristic feature of the prodromal stage of measles, not the exanthematous stage. Skin desquamation is not a typical feature of measles. Catarrh and conjunctivitis are symptoms that can occur in the prodromal stage of measles, but they are not specific to the exanthematous stage. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

###Question: A 9-month old presents with axillary temperature of 40.8ºC with demonstrable asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum on blood film. Which of the complications is least likely to be present in the child? 


###Options:
A.  Severe anaemia
B.  Hypoglycaemia
C.  Acute renal insufficiency
D.  Haemoglobinuria
E.  Hyperbilirubinaemia

###Answer:","E.  Hyperbilirubinaemia

Rationale: Hyperbilirubinaemia is not a complication of malaria. The other options are all possible complications of malaria, especially in severe cases. Severe anaemia is a common complication of malaria due to the destruction of red blood cells by the parasite. Hypoglycaemia is a complication of malaria due to the parasite's effect on glucose metabolism. Acute renal insufficiency can occur due to the parasite's effect on the kidneys. Haemoglobinuria is a complication of malaria due to the breakdown of red blood cells. Therefore, hyperbilirubinaemia is the least likely complication of malaria. 

Note: The question is testing the ability to identify the least likely complication of malaria in a child with severe malaria. The correct answer requires knowledge of the complications of malaria and the ability to eliminate the options that are more likely to occur. 

This question requires the following reasoning skills for Scientific Evidence Evaluation:
- Knowledge of the complications of malaria

###Options:
A.  Bleeding gums
B.  Oliguria
C.  Inability to stand erect
D.  Severe pallor
E.  Ptosis

###Answer:","C.  Inability to stand erect
Rationale: The child has hyperkalemia (serum potassium 5.6mmol/l) and hypocalcemia (serum calcium 6.7mg/dl). The clinical feature that matches the condition is inability to stand erect, which is a sign of hypocalcemia. The child may experience muscle cramps, spasms, and tetany due to hypocalcemia. The other options do not match the condition. Bleeding gums are associated with vitamin C deficiency, oliguria is associated with renal failure, severe pallor is associated with anemia, and ptosis is associated with neurological disorders.  Inability to stand erect is a sign of hypocalcemia, which is a result of hyperkalemia in the context of Burkitt’s Lymphoma.  The high levels of potassium can lead to hypocalcemia by promoting the deposition of calcium in the bone.  The child may also experience muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia.  The clinical feature that matches the condition is inability to stand erect, which is a sign of hypocalcemia.  The other options do not match the condition.

###Options:
A.  Nephroblastoma
B.  Cystitis
C.  Schistosomiasis
D.  Renal vein thrombosis

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that is endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions. It is a major cause of haematuria in children in these regions. The infection is usually acquired through contact with contaminated water. The haematuria is typically painless. Nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour) is a common renal tumour in children, but it usually presents with a palpable abdominal mass and haematuria is not always present. Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by infection. It can cause painful haematuria. Renal vein thrombosis is a blood clot in the renal vein, which can cause haematuria, but it is usually associated with other symptoms such as flank pain and hypertension. Therefore, the most likely aetiology of painless haematuria in this context is schistosomiasis.  Note: The question is based on a scenario that is typical of a developing country. In a developed country, the most likely aetiology of painless haematuria in a child would be a renal tumour.  Note: The question is based on a scenario that is typical of a developing country.

A.  Sickle cell disease is inherited in autosomal dominant pattern
B.  Both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation.
C.  Most common variant of sickle cell disease is due to nonsense mutation.
D.  It is a sex-linked disorder.

###Answer:","B
Rationale: Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. The mutated gene is located on chromosome 11. The disease is not sex-linked. The most common variant of sickle cell disease is due to a point mutation in the HBB gene, which codes for the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation results in a substitution of glutamic acid with valine at position 6 of the beta-globin protein. This is not a nonsense mutation. A nonsense mutation would result in a premature stop codon and a truncated protein. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  Option A is incorrect because sickle cell disease is not inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Option C is incorrect because the most common variant of sickle cell disease is not due to a nonsense mutation. Option D is incorrect because sickle cell disease is not a sex-linked disorder.  Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  Option A is incorrect because sickle cell disease is not inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Option C is incorrect because the most common variant of sickle cell disease is not due to a nonsense mutation. Option D is incorrect because sickle cell disease is not a sex-linked disorder.

###Question: Which of these is the most probable risk factor for HBV infection in a 3 year old boy from a rural area in Nigeria?



###Options:
A.  Sharing of infected needles
B.  Circumcision
C.  Blood transfusion
D.  Needle stick accidents

###Answer:","B.  Circumcision

Rationale: 
Circumcision is a common practice in many African countries, including Nigeria. The procedure is often performed in unhygienic conditions, and the use of non-sterile equipment can lead to the transmission of blood-borne pathogens, including HBV. In a rural area, the risk of HBV infection through circumcision is higher due to the lack of proper medical facilities and equipment. Therefore, option B is the most probable risk factor for HBV infection in a 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Nigeria. 

Note: The other options are less likely to be the correct answer because sharing of infected needles (A) is more common in areas with high rates of intravenous drug use, blood transfusion (C) is a risk factor in areas with inadequate screening of blood donations, and needle stick accidents (D) are more common in healthcare settings. While these options are possible risk factors, they are less likely to be the most probable risk factor in a rural area in Nigeria.  . 

This question requires the test-taker to analyze the situation and choose the most likely risk factor based on the context provided. It requires critical thinking and an understanding of the epidemiology of HBV infection. 

This type of question is appropriate for assessing the test-taker's ability to apply knowledge in a practical scenario, which is an important aspect of clinical reasoning. 

The question is also relevant to the topic of HBV infection and requires the test-taker to think critically about the risk factors associated with the infection.

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The most common complication of measles is bronchopneumonia. This is because measles virus can cause inflammation in the lungs, leading to pneumonia. Bronchopneumonia is a type of pneumonia that affects the bronchioles and alveoli of the lungs, and it is a common complication of measles, especially in children. The other options, myocarditis, laryngitis, and acute encephalitis, are also potential complications of measles, but they are less common than bronchopneumonia. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx, and acute encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, all of which can be serious complications of measles, but they are not as common as bronchopneumonia.

###Answer:","C.  Haemoglobinuria

Rationale: The child is presenting with high fever and asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum on blood film, which is indicative of malaria. In severe malaria, especially in children, there is a high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the sequestration of parasitized red blood cells in the microvasculature of the kidneys. This can lead to haemoglobinuria, which is the presence of haemoglobin in the urine. This is a result of the breakdown of red blood cells in the kidneys. The other options are not directly related to the presentation of malaria in a child. Pulmonary oedema is a complication of severe malaria, but it is not the most likely finding in this scenario. Acute renal insufficiency is a possible complication, but it is not as specific as haemoglobinuria.

###Options:
A.  Sickle cell anaemia.
B.  Iron deficiency
C.  Glucose-6- Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency.
D.  Septicaemia.

###Answer:","B.  Iron deficiency

Rationale: The haematocrit levels in the population of rural primary school children in Nigeria range from 23% to 26%. This is lower than the normal haematocrit level of 37-48% in adults. The most likely aetiology of the condition is iron deficiency. This is because iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia in children, especially in developing countries where there is a high prevalence of malnutrition. The low haematocrit levels in the population suggest that the children are anaemic, and iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia in children. The other options are not supported by the information provided. Sickle cell anaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin, but it is not typically associated with low haematocrit levels. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells, but it is not typically associated with low haematocrit levels. Septicaemia is a bacterial infection that can cause anaemia, but it is not typically associated with low haematocrit levels in children.

###Question: A 4-year-old child presents with sudden breathlessness following drinking from a plastic soft drink container. He smells of kerosene, has a loud grunt, respiratory rate of 96/minute, subcostal recession and bilaterally reduced breath sounds. Which of the following management steps must be avoided?
###Options:
A.  Cardiac positioning
B.  Insertion of venous cannula
C.  Administration of activated charcoal
D.  Gastric lavage

###Answer:","D
Rationale: Gastric lavage is contraindicated in hydrocarbon poisoning as it can cause aspiration of the hydrocarbon into the lungs, leading to severe chemical pneumonitis. The child has symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chemical pneumonitis. The management of hydrocarbon poisoning involves supportive care, including oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and monitoring for complications. The child should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position to prevent aspiration of the hydrocarbon into the lungs. A venous cannula can be inserted for fluid administration and blood sampling. Activated charcoal can be administered to prevent further absorption of the hydrocarbon. Cardiac positioning is not a relevant management step in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Gastric lavage.  Note: The question is based on the scenario of a child who has ingested hydrocarbons, which is a common cause of poisoning in children. The management of hydrocarbon poisoning is focused on supportive care and preventing further absorption of the hydrocarbon. Gastric lavage is contraindicated in hydrocarbon poisoning due to the risk of aspiration into the lungs. The other options are relevant management steps in this scenario.

A.  Point A corresponds to where the uterine artery passes under the ureter
B.  Wertheims hysterectomy involves removal of the ovaries
C.  Brachytherapy is difficult in cancer of the stump of the cervix
D.  Cancer of the cervix is the most common cancer in Nigerian women
E.  Screening every 5 years is recommended

###Answer:","C
Rationale: Brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the tumour. It is commonly used in the treatment of cancer of the cervix. However, it is difficult to use in cancer of the stump of the cervix because the radioactive source cannot be placed close to the tumour due to the presence of the remaining stump. Therefore, option C is correct. Option A is incorrect because point A is the location of the uterine artery and vein where they cross the ureter. Option B is incorrect because Wertheim's hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus, cervix, upper part of the vagina, and parametrium, but not the ovaries. Option D is incorrect because cancer of the cervix is not the most common cancer in Nigerian women. Option E is incorrect because screening every 2 years is recommended.

###Question: A 10-year old female with chronic cough has a tuberculin test result of 10mm. What should the next important line of action be?

###Options:
A.  Request Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate.
B.  Request a Chest X-ray.
C.  Commence anti-tuberculous drugs.
D.  Request BCG vaccine administration.

###Answer:","B.  Request a Chest X-ray.

Rationale: The tuberculin test is a screening tool for latent tuberculosis infection. A positive result (induration of 5mm or more) in a child with chronic cough warrants further investigation. The next step is to request a chest X-ray to look for signs of active tuberculosis. The chest X-ray can help differentiate between latent and active tuberculosis. The other options are not the next appropriate line of action. Requesting an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is not relevant to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Commencing anti-tuberculous drugs without a confirmed diagnosis of active tuberculosis is not appropriate. Requesting BCG vaccine administration is not relevant to the diagnosis or management of this patient.

###Answer:","D
Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with blepharitis, an inflammatory condition of the eyelids. The first-line treatment for blepharitis includes warm compresses, lid margin scrubs with a cotton swab dipped in diluted baby shampoo, and avoidance of eye makeup. Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is also a first-line treatment for blepharitis. Oral doxycycline is an alternative treatment for blepharitis, but it is not considered a first-line treatment.
