###Answer:","E. All of the above

Rationale:
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency or insulin resistance. In African adults, untreated diabetes mellitus can lead to several complications, including diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease in Africa. Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of blindness in African adults with diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy can manifest as peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, or both, and can lead to various complications, including foot ulcers and infections. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes that occurs when there is a lack of insulin in the body, leading to the breakdown of fat for energy, resulting in the production of ketone bodies. While diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes, it is less common in African adults due to the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, which is less likely to result in diabetic ketoacidosis compared to type 1 diabetes.

Rationale:
Major omphalocele is a congenital defect characterized by the herniation of the abdominal contents through the umbilical ring. Operative management of major omphalocele involves reducing the herniated contents back into the abdominal cavity and closing the defect. Prosthetic silos are commonly used in the management of major omphalocele as they provide a gradual reduction of the herniated contents back into the abdominal cavity over a period of time. This allows the abdominal wall to grow and develop, making closure of the defect possible.

###Question:  A 40-year-old African patient presents with a painful, swollen knee that is warm to the touch. Synovial fluid analysis reveals an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Osteoarthritis
B.  Rheumatoid arthritis
C.  Septic arthritis
D.  Gout
E.  Pseudogout

###Answer:","C. Septic arthritis
Rationale:
The symptoms described in the patient's presentation, such as a painful, swollen knee that is warm to the touch, along with the results of the synovial fluid analysis, which shows an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance, are consistent with a diagnosis of septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is an infection of the synovial fluid in a joint, typically caused by bacterial pathogens. The presence of a large number of neutrophils in the synovial fluid is a hallmark of an acute bacterial infection. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and pseudogout are all conditions that can cause joint pain and swelling, but they do not typically present with the same symptoms as septic arthritis, such as a warm, swollen joint with an elevated white blood cell count and neutrophil predominance.",C,True,0.32989690394303334,0.10294117406682532,0.2680412338399405,0.85076576,0.92249197,0.88517827

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer in Africa, as well as in many other parts of the world. IDC is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells that have invaded the breast tissue from a duct. This type of breast cancer can also spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

###Question: A 45-year-old African patient presents with a history of chronic knee pain, swelling, and instability, worse with physical activity. Physical examination reveals joint laxity and a positive Lachman test. Imaging reveals a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option?
###Options:
A.  Conservative management with physical therapy
B.  Open ACL repair
C.  Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction
D.  Knee brace immobilization
E.  Corticosteroid injection into the knee joint

###Answer:","C. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a torn ACL. Conservative management with physical therapy may provide some relief of symptoms but is unlikely to restore normal knee function or stability. Open ACL repair is an older surgical technique that has largely been replaced by arthroscopic surgery due to its greater invasiveness and longer recovery time. Knee brace immobilization may provide some support but will not address the underlying injury. Corticosteroid injections into the knee joint may provide temporary pain relief but do not address the underlying injury and may increase the risk of infection or other complications. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is the most appropriate treatment option for a torn ACL as it allows for minimally invasive repair of the ligament, with faster recovery times and improved functional outcomes compared to open surgery.",C,True,0.15652173637202274,0.01342281646772708,0.13913043202419662,0.82788634,0.8941401,0.8597387

###Answer:","E. Gout
Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of progressive hip pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, along with imaging findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, are consistent with osteoarthritis (A). However, the laboratory finding of elevated serum uric acid levels points towards a diagnosis of gout (E). Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to acute attacks of joint pain and inflammation. The presence of subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation in this patient may represent chronic gouty arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (B) typically presents with symmetric joint involvement, morning stiffness, and a positive rheumatoid factor test. Avascular necrosis (C) can also cause joint pain and stiffness, but it is typically associated with a history of trauma or steroid use, and imaging findings of subchondral cysts and bone infarcts.

###Question: In a rural African setting with limited access to specialized cardiac care, a patient presents with symptoms of infective endocarditis. Which of the following is a common complication of infective endocarditis that may require surgical intervention?
###Options:
A.  Aortic regurgitation
B.  Mitral regurgitation
C.  Ventricular septal defect
D.  Atrial fibrillation
E.  Aortic dissection

###Answer:","E. Aortic dissection

Rationale:
Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, the inner layer of the heart chambers and heart valves. Common complications of infective endocarditis include valvular damage, such as regurgitation, and embolic events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. However, aortic dissection is a more severe and potentially life-threatening complication that may require urgent surgical intervention. Aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the inner layer of the aortic wall, allowing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, separating them and creating a false channel. This can lead to the dissection spreading and potentially causing rupture of the aorta. In a rural African setting with limited access to specialized cardiac care, a patient with infective endocarditis who presents with symptoms of aortic dissection, such as sudden severe chest pain, back pain, or pulse deficits, should be urgently referred for surgical intervention. Aortic dissection is a medical emergency that can be fatal if not treated promptly. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

Options:
A.  Aspirin
B.  Clopidogrel
C.  Warfarin
D.  Heparin

Answer: D. Heparin

Rationale:
Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, the inner layer of the heart chambers and heart valves. Anticoagulation therapy is often used to prevent the formation of blood clots that can embolize and cause complications, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Heparin is a commonly used anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting thrombin and activating antithrombin III. It is often administered intravenously in the acute phase of infective endocarditis to prevent the formation of new clots and to reduce the risk of embolic events. Warfarin is another anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting the activity of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

###Answer:","C. Placenta previa

Rationale:
Placenta previa is a common cause of obstetric emergencies in Africa due to its high prevalence rate. Placenta previa occurs when the placenta covers the cervix, which can lead to bleeding during pregnancy and labor. This condition increases the risk of preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum hemorrhage. In Africa, the prevalence of placenta previa is estimated to be between 1% and 5%, which is higher than in other regions of the world. Additionally, the lack of access to prenatal care and emergency obstetric services in many African countries can make the management of placenta previa more challenging and increase the risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.",C,False,0.23076922674741132,0.10218977760136405,0.23076922674741132,0.84251493,0.8635926,0.8529235

Rationale:
Glomerulonephritis is a common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in African populations. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli, which are the tiny filtering units in the kidneys. Glomerulonephritis can be caused by various infections, such as bacterial or viral infections, or by autoimmune processes. In African populations, common causes of glomerulonephritis include bacterial infections such as streptococcal infections and schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection. Therefore, glomerulonephritis is a significant contributor to the high prevalence of CKD in this population.

C.  Iron deficiency anemia
D.  Hereditary spherocytosis
E.  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

###Answer:","A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)

Rationale:
The patient's presentation of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, along with laboratory findings of normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive DAT, is most consistent with AIHA. AIHA is characterized by the production of antibodies against red blood cells, leading to their destruction and subsequent anemia. The thrombocytopenia in this case is likely due to the immune-mediated destruction of platelets as well. TTP and MDS can also present with similar symptoms, but they typically have different laboratory findings and clinical features. TTP is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, and renal dysfunction. MDS is characterized by anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia, with bone marrow dysplasia and/or the presence of blasts. Hereditary spherocytosis is a congenital disorder characterized by the production of abnormally shaped red blood cells, which are more susceptible to hemolysis.

The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, night sweats, myalgia, and headache, along with the presence of eosinophilia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, are highly suggestive of miliary tuberculosis. The patient's recent travel history to East Africa increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as tuberculosis is endemic in that region. Eosinophilia is not a common finding in malaria, and schistosomiasis typically presents with a rash in the genital or perianal area, rather than an itchy rash all over the body. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare condition that typically presents with systemic symptoms, including fever, weight loss, and organ involvement, but does not typically present with pulmonary infiltrates or eosinophilia. Trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness, typically presents with neurological symptoms, such as insomnia, confusion, and memory loss, rather than respiratory symptoms.",B,False,0.21192052504012993,0.020202015661158045,0.18543045881496437,0.8171303,0.84616864,0.831396

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common cause of chronic liver disease in African adults. The prevalence of HBV infection in Africa is much higher than in other parts of the world, with an estimated 10% of the population being chronically infected. HBV is transmitted through blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and other bodily fluids. In Africa, the most common modes of transmission are mother-to-child transmission during childbirth and through contaminated needles during medical procedures.

###Answer:","A. Osteoarthritis

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of chronic hip pain and stiffness, worse with weight-bearing and relieved by rest, along with the imaging findings of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, are most consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage and the development of new bone in and around the joint. The imaging findings are typical of OA, and the patient's age and ethnicity are also risk factors for this condition.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically presents with symmetric joint involvement, morning stiffness, and a positive rheumatoid factor test. Avascular necrosis (AVN) can present with hip pain and imaging findings of joint space narrowing and subchondral bone changes, but the patient's age and the absence of other risk factors for AVN (such as corticosteroid use or alcoholism) make this less likely. Septic arthritis is characterized by acute onset of joint pain, fever, and systemic symptoms, and imaging findings of joint effusion and destruction.

Rationale:
Rice water stools are a common presentation of cholera, especially in endemic areas of Africa. This is due to the large volume of water and electrolytes lost in the diarrhea, which can cause the stools to resemble rice water. Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae and is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if left untreated.

Additionally, she has Crohn's disease and is taking oral sulphasalazine, which does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer. The LNG-IUS is an effective option for menorrhagia, and it has the added benefit of providing contraception. Hysterectomy and subtotal hysterectomy are invasive procedures that should be considered as last resorts, especially in young women with menorrhagia who still desire fertility. Injectable long-acting progestogens are another option for menorrhagia, but they are typically reserved for women who cannot use or tolerate an intrauterine device.",C,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72413677,0.8595313,0.7860463

Rationale:
Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic infection caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. It is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction in Africa. The parasites lay their eggs in the intestinal wall, which can cause inflammation, fibrosis, and granuloma formation, leading to intestinal obstruction.

E.  e.	Volvulus

###Answer:","C. Band and adhesions

Rationale:
Band and adhesions are the most common causes of small bowel obstruction in Ghana. This is due to the high prevalence of previous surgeries, especially cesarean sections, which can lead to the formation of adhesions. Additionally, the use of traditional herbal medicines and ill-prepared food can contribute to the formation of bands.

###Answer:","A. Urine output (24 hours) of <400ml in adults

Rationale:
Urine output of less than 400ml in 24 hours is not a symptom of adverse malaria. This is because malaria does not typically cause renal failure or significant impairment of renal function.

Rationale:
Ceftriaxone is the preferred antibiotic for empirical treatment of bacterial meningitis due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier effectively and its broad spectrum of activity against common causative organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. It also has a longer half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing, which is convenient for patients and reduces the risk of dosing errors. Cefuroxime and Cefepime are also effective against common causative organisms but are less commonly used for empirical treatment due to their lack of penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the need for more frequent dosing, respectively.

###Answer:","C. Thick slides have higher sensitivity compared to thin slides on microscopy

Rationale:
Thick blood films are used in the initial diagnosis of malaria, especially in areas where the prevalence of malaria is high. They are more sensitive than thin films because they allow the detection of parasites at lower densities. Thin films, on the other hand, are used for follow-up examinations or when the parasite density is high.

###Answer:","B. CD4 lymphocytes

Rationale:
HIV primarily infects CD4+ T cells, which are a subset of T lymphocytes. These cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. The virus enters the CD4 cells by binding to the CD4 receptor and the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors on the cell surface. Once inside the cell, HIV replicates and spreads to other CD4+ T cells, leading to a progressive decline in the number of CD4+ T cells and impairment of the immune response. This is why people with HIV/AIDS have a reduced number of CD4+ T cells in their blood.

###Answer:","C. Bacterial meningitis

Rationale:
Serial lumbar punctures are recommended in bacterial meningitis to reduce intracranial pressure by removing excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This procedure helps to alleviate the pressure on the brain and prevent complications such as brain herniation. In contrast, in other forms of meningitis like tuberculous, cryptococcal, or viral meningitis, serial lumbar punctures are generally not recommended due to the risk of causing iatrogenic complications such as cerebral herniation or CSF leak.

###Options:
A.  Community-acquired pneumonia
B.  Chronic bronchitis
C.  Emphysema
D.  Tuberculosis
E.  Pulmonary embolism

###Answer:","A. Community-acquired pneumonia

Rationale:
The symptoms of fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain for 4 days duration are most consistent with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CAP is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that are acquired in the community rather than in a hospital setting. The symptoms of CAP can range from mild to severe and may include fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and pleuritic pain. Other conditions such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism can also present with similar symptoms, but their clinical presentations and diagnostic findings are distinct from CAP. For example, chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic cough and sputum production, emphysema is characterized by shortness of breath and decreased lung function, tuberculosis is characterized by a prolonged cough with blood-streaked sputum and systemic symptoms, and pulmonary embolism is characterized by sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemoptysis.

###Answer:","A. GeneXpert
Rationale: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of GeneXpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults in Kenya due to its high sensitivity and specificity, rapid turnaround time, and ability to detect rifampicin resistance.

GeneXpert testing is also recommended for contacts of TB patients and for people with HIV infection, as they are at higher risk for TB and may benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. While sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFBs) and chest radiographs are still used in the diagnosis of TB, they are less sensitive and specific than GeneXpert, and sputum culture and sensitivity tests are time-consuming and require specialized laboratory facilities.

###Answer:","D. Mycoplasma pneumonia

Rationale:
Mycoplasma pneumonia is a common cause of atypical pneumonia. It is a bacterium that lacks a cell wall and can therefore evade the host's immune response more effectively than other bacterial pathogens. This leads to a less severe clinical presentation compared to typical bacterial pneumonias caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Additionally, Mycoplasma pneumonia often presents with a prodromal period of flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, and malaise, before the development of chest symptoms.

Rationale:
Endotracheal intubation for 5 days is a risk factor for ventilator-associated pneumonia, not community-acquired pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia is an infection that is acquired outside of a hospital or long-term care facility. Alcoholism, diabetes, COPD, and steroid use are all risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia. Alcoholism can weaken the immune system and make it harder for the body to fight off infections. Diabetes can cause high blood sugar levels, which can make it easier for bacteria to grow and infect the lungs. COPD can make it harder for the body to clear mucus and debris from the lungs, making it easier for bacteria to take hold. Steroid use can suppress the immune system and make it harder for the body to fight off infections.",D,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.74971306,0.8506282,0.79698884

C.  A vaccine is not available
D.  MDR-TB refers to TB that is resistant to Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
E.  It does not affect cattle

###Answer:","B. First-line therapy in adults consists of 4 drugs

Rationale:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The standard treatment for TB involves a combination of antibiotics to ensure the complete elimination of the bacteria. The first-line therapy for adults typically consists of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. This combination is effective in treating most cases of TB and is the recommended treatment by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Therefore, the correct answer is B. First-line therapy in adults consists of 4 drugs.

Explanation:
A. Tuberculin skin test is diagnostic: False. The tuberculin skin test is used to detect a previous infection with TB, but it is not diagnostic on its own. A positive test result indicates that the person has been exposed to TB bacteria, but it does not necessarily mean that they have active TB disease.

C. A vaccine is not available: False. There is a vaccine available for TB, but it is not very effective and is not widely used. The BCG vaccine, which stands for Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, has been in use since the 1920s and provides some protection against severe forms of TB, such as tuberculous meningitis and disseminated TB. However, it is not very effective in preventing pulmonary TB, which is the most common form of the disease.

D. MDR-TB refers to TB that is resistant to Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol: False. MDR-TB stands for multidrug-resistant TB, which is a strain of TB that is resistant to at least two first-line drugs, usually isoniazid and rifampicin. Pyrazinamide and ethambutol are not always included in the first-line drugs used to treat MDR-TB, and some strains of MDR-TB may be resistant to these drugs as well.

E. It does not affect cattle: False. TB can affect cattle as well as humans. TB in cattle",B,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.71634305,0.83867323,0.77269644

###Answer:","E. Staphylococcus aureus
Rationale: Staphylococcus aureus causes diarrhea that is often described as having a ""pudding-like"" consistency, rather than watery. This is because the toxin produced by the bacteria causes the intestines to secrete mucus and water, but it also causes the intestinal muscles to contract, leading to the characteristic ""pudding-like"" stools. Watery diarrhea, on the other hand, is typically caused by viruses or bacteria that do not produce toxins, such as norovirus, cryptosporidium, and shigella.

###Question: A 24-year-old presents with fever, dyspnea, and cough for 3 weeks. Chest auscultation is unremarkable. Chest radiograph shows bilateral peri-hilar interstitial infiltrates in a butterfly pattern. His HIV antibody test is positive. Which of the following is TRUE?
###Options:
A.  Cryptococcosis is the most likely diagnosis
B.  Cotrimoxazole is second-line therapy in patients who do not respond to macrolides
C.  Dapsone has no role in the management
D.  Tuberculous lymphadenitis explains the findings
E.  Oral corticosteroids are indicated if oxygen saturation falls below 88%

###Answer:","A. Cryptococcosis is the most likely diagnosis

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals. The butterfly pattern on chest radiograph is a characteristic finding in cryptococcosis. Cryptococcosis is caused by the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and is typically treated with antifungal agents such as fluconazole or amphotericin B. Corticosteroids may be used in certain cases to reduce inflammation and improve respiratory symptoms, but they are not first-line therapy for cryptococcosis. Cotrimoxazole is a first-line antibiotic for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-positive individuals, but it is not effective against cryptococcosis. Dapsone is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, but it is not effective against cryptococcosis. Tuberculous lymphadenitis can present with similar symptoms and radiographic findings, but it is less likely in the absence of cavitary lesions on chest radiograph. Oxygen therapy may be indicated in patients with hypoxemia, but corticosteroids are not typically indicated unless there is evidence of significant airway obstruction or other indications for their use.",A,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7305794,0.848477,0.78512686

A.  He should get vaccinated with BCG
B.  A positive Mantoux test indicates excellent protection against TB
C.  N-95 Filter is more effective than a surgical mask in preventing aerosol inhalation
D.  He should offer IPT (Isoniazid preventive therapy) to HIV patients with cough, fever, and night sweats
E.  He should delay anti-retroviral therapy in HIV/TB co-infected patients till they complete TB therapy

###Answer:","D. He should offer IPT (Isoniazid preventive therapy) to HIV patients with cough, fever, and night sweats

Rationale:
The Level Six student is at risk of getting tuberculosis (TB) while working in the medical wards. To prevent the acquisition of TB, the student should follow the standard infection control measures, including wearing a surgical mask, using personal protective equipment, and practicing good respiratory hygiene. However, since he is a healthcare worker, he is also at risk of getting TB from patients. Therefore, he should offer Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) to HIV patients with cough, fever, and night sweats to prevent the transmission of TB to him and other patients. BCG vaccine is not effective in preventing TB in adults, and a positive Mantoux test does not indicate excellent protection against TB. N-95 filters are more effective than surgical masks in preventing aerosol inhalation, but they are not necessary for routine patient care.

B.  Dapsone can be used when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated for prophylaxis and should be continued indefinitely
C.  Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months
D.  A course of Isoniazid preventive therapy should only be offered to patients who have a history of TB contact
E.  Pre-emptive Fluconazole therapy should be given to all patients with a CD4 < 100cells/uL when they are initiating antiretroviral treatment

###Answer:","C. Primary prophylaxis for PCP may be discontinued when the CD4 is maintained >200cells/uL for more than 6 months

Rationale:
The statement C is true. According to the current guidelines, primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) can be discontinued in HIV patients with a CD4 count >200 cells/μL for more than 6 months without a history of PCP or other risk factors for PCP. This is because the risk of developing PCP decreases significantly when the CD4 count is above this threshold. However, it is important to note that the decision to discontinue PCP prophylaxis should be individualized based on the patient's clinical and immunologic status, as well as their risk factors for PCP.

Explanation for other options:
A. Universal prophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole is NOT mandatory for all patients unless contraindicated. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended for HIV patients with a CD4 count <200 cells/μL or a history of PCP, but it is not mandatory for all patients.

B. Dapsone can be used when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated for prophylaxis, but it should NOT be continued indefinitely. Dapsone is an alternative prophylaxis for PCP when Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated, but it should be discontinued once the CD4 count is above the threshold for discontinuing PCP prophylaxis (i.e., >200 cells/μL for more than 6 months).

D. A course of Isoniazid preventive therapy should be offered to patients who have a history of TB contact, but it is NOT limited to these patients. Isoniazid preventive therapy is recommended for HIV patients who are at high risk for TB infection, including those with a history of TB contact, as well as those with a CD4 count <350 cells/μL or a history of active TB.

E.  Laboratory variations and errors are not a consideration

###Answer:","C. A repeat viral load should be done in 6 months and if similar levels are obtained, he should be switched to a second-line regimen

Rationale:
The patient's viral load being detectable after a long period of undetectable viral loads suggests the possibility of antiretroviral treatment failure. A repeat viral load should be done to confirm the result and if similar levels are obtained, the patient should be switched to a second-line regimen. Intercurrent infections can cause transient increases in viral load but would not be expected to cause persistent detectable viral load. Adherence counseling and directly observed treatment would be appropriate for patients with suspected adherence issues, not those with confirmed treatment failure.

A head CT shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe, with edema but no mass effect. A lumbar puncture shows no white or red blood cells, and the Gram stain is negative. His serum Toxoplasma IgG is positive. Which of the following is the best course of action for this patient at this time?
###Options:
A.  Biopsy of the central nervous system (CNS) lesion
B.  Dexamethasone
C.  Search for systemic malignancy
D.  Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis
E.  Whole-brain radiation therapy

###Answer:","D. Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis
Rationale:
The patient's presentation of a new-onset seizure, small lymphadenopathy, positive Toxoplasma IgG, and a ring-enhancing lesion on CT scan with no mass effect is highly suggestive of CNS toxoplasmosis. This is a common complication of AIDS, and prompt treatment with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid is necessary to prevent further neurologic damage and potential death. Biopsy of the CNS lesion would carry a risk of complications and may not provide additional diagnostic information in this case. Dexamethasone may be used to reduce edema, but it does not address the underlying cause of the lesion. Searching for systemic malignancy would be a less likely diagnosis given the patient's presentation, and whole-brain radiation therapy is not the first-line treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis.",D,True,0.02247190967302109,0.0,0.02247190967302109,0.745551,0.85720885,0.79749054

###Answer:","B. H.pylori

Rationale:
Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by the formation of ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. In Malawi, the most common cause of PUD is Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. H. pylori is a gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa and is associated with the development of PUD. Alcohol consumption and genetics are also known risk factors for PUD, but they are less common causes in Malawi compared to H. pylori infection.

###Answer:","C. HIV associated nephropathy

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of anasarca, proteinuria (3+ on dipstick), hematuria (I+ on dipstick), and low serum albumin are consistent with nephrotic syndrome. However, the fact that the patient is HIV positive makes HIV associated nephropathy the most likely diagnosis. HIV associated nephropathy is a common complication of HIV infection and can present with nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome can also be caused by other conditions such as diabetes, amyloidosis, and lupus, but these conditions are less likely in this case given the patient's HIV status and lack of other symptoms. Disseminated TB can also cause proteinuria and hematuria, but it typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats, which are not present in this case.

###Options:
A.  impaired antibody response/cell mediated response
B.  hypersensitivity response toproducts of TB bacteria
C.  due to expanding granuloma
D.  due to caseous necrosis
E.  direct host cell killing by the bacillus

###Answer:","C. due to expanding granuloma

Rationale:
Mycobacterium TB is a slow-growing intracellular bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). The pathogenicity of Mycobacterium TB is primarily due to its ability to evade the host immune system and establish a persistent infection. The expanding granuloma is a characteristic feature of TB lesions, which is a response of the host immune system to contain the infection. The granuloma is composed of various immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts, which form a multicellular structure to wall off the infection. The granuloma helps to prevent the spread of the infection to other parts of the body, but it also provides a protective environment for the bacteria to survive and replicate. Therefore, the expanding granuloma is the primary cause of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium TB.

Option A is incorrect because impaired antibody response and cell-mediated response are not the primary causes of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium TB. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to neutralize or eliminate pathogens, and cell-mediated immunity is a type of immune response that involves the direct interaction between immune cells and pathogens. Mycobacterium TB is an intracellular bacterium that can evade both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses.

Option B is incorrect because hypersensitivity response to products of TB bacteria is not the primary cause of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium TB. Hypersensitivity responses are immune responses that occur when the immune system overreacts to harmless antigens or to antigens that are no longer present. Tuberculosis is caused by the presence of live Mycobacterium TB bacteria, and the immune response to these bacteria is primarily a cell-mediated response, not a hypersensitivity response.

Option D is incorrect because caseous necrosis is a result of the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium TB, not the cause. Caseous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when the immune response to Mycobacterium TB results",C,False,0.015748031186062376,0.0,0.015748031186062376,0.712571,0.8377251,0.77009624

C.  Cause formation of epithelioid cell granulomas
D.  Are killed by macrophages in primary infection
E.  Are killed by macrophages in primary infection

###Answer:","C. Cause formation of epithelioid cell granulomas

Rationale:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. The bacteria are slow-growing, non-motile, and non-spore forming, and they are aerobic, meaning they require oxygen to survive. However, they can also survive in low oxygen environments.

Mycobacteria tuberculosis induces a type 4 hypersensitivity response, not type 2. Type 4 responses involve cell-mediated immunity and the activation of T-cells, which is important in the immune response to TB.

One of the hallmarks of TB infection is the formation of granulomas, which are collections of immune cells, including epithelioid cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes, that surround and contain the bacteria. The granulomas help to contain the infection and prevent the spread of the bacteria to other parts of the body.

E.  Quinine is the first-line drug of choice in uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria

###Answer:","D. Only 52% of P. Vivax are evident within a month

Rationale:
The life cycle of Plasmodium parasites, which cause malaria, includes the sporozoite stage, the hepatic schizont stage, the merozoite stage, and the erythrocytic schizont stage. The clinical symptoms of malaria begin when merozoites invade and rupture red blood cells, releasing more merozoites to infect new cells. Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale can cause relapses due to the presence of hypnozoites, which are dormant forms of the parasite in the liver that can reactivate and cause new infections. P. falciparum does not have a dormant liver stage. Approximately 52% of P. vivax infections become evident within a month, while the remaining parasites remain in the liver and can cause relapses later on.

However, one common feature of most helminth infections in humans is that they typically cause lifelong infections. This means that once a person is infected, they may continue to carry the parasites for years or even decades, despite the development of some degree of immunity. This is in contrast to many other types of infections, such as bacterial or viral infections, which may be acute and self-limiting. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Explanation:
Option A is incorrect because many helminths do multiply in the host, either by laying eggs or by undergoing developmental stages within the host. Option B is incorrect because helminth infections often provoke eosinophilia, which is an increase in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in response to the parasitic infection. Option C is incorrect because the severity of helminth infections can vary widely depending on the species and the individual host. Some helminth infections may cause only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, while others can cause severe disease and even death. Option E is a distractor, as it is a statement about a specific helminth (Schistosoma) rather than a characteristic of all helminths that infect humans.",D,False,0.013698629866766752,0.0,0.013698629866766752,0.7393288,0.84394467,0.78818053

###Answer:","E. More than 10 years

Rationale:
The elimination of onchocerciasis requires the interruption of transmission for a period of time long enough for the microfilariae to disappear from the skin and the adult worms to die. This process can take more than 10 years, especially if neither individuals nor the population are treated. Vector control alone is not sufficient to eliminate the disease, as it only reduces the vector population and does not directly target the parasites. Therefore, the answer is E.

###Answer:","A. Scabies

Rationale:
The presentation of multiple papules and exudative lesions on the face, scalp, trunk, palms, and soles for 2 weeks, along with a history of itchy lesions in the mother, is most consistent with scabies. Scabies is a highly contagious skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. It typically presents with pruritic papules, vesicles, and burrows. The involvement of the palms and soles is a common feature in infants. While eczema and seborrheic dermatitis can present with similar lesions, they typically do not have the same distribution or the associated itch in the mother.

###Answer:","C. Keratitis

Rationale:
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. The disease is transmitted through the bites of blackflies. The main clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis include skin lesions, eye involvement, and lymphatic filariasis.

C.  Convulsions
D.  Myocarditis
E.  hematochezia

###Answer:","C. Convulsions
Rationale: Acute Schistosomiasis is a condition caused by the release of schistosome eggs into the bloodstream, leading to an immune response and inflammation. While paraparesis (weakness in the legs), eosinophilia (increased number of eosinophils in the blood), and hematochezia (blood in the stool) can be symptoms of Schistosomiasis, convulsions are more commonly associated with Acute Schistosomiasis due to the release of toxins from the eggs.

###Question: Which of these is true about cholera
###Options:
A.  Low gastric pH protects against infection
B.  Cholera toxin produces its effect by reducing intracellular levels of cAMP
C.  Fever is usual in adults
D.  Vibrio cholera of the 01 serotype is the only cause of clinical disease.
E.  Responds to therapy with Amoxiclav.

###Answer:","B. Cholera toxin produces its effect by reducing intracellular levels of cAMP.

Rationale:
Cholera is a diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The toxin produced by this bacterium, called cholera toxin, is responsible for the symptoms of the disease. Cholera toxin is an AB5 toxin, meaning it consists of a catalytic A subunit and five B subunits that bind to ganglioside receptors on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Once bound, the A subunit enters the cell and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. However, cholera toxin also has the ability to inhibit the action of phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cAMP. This results in a persistent increase in cAMP levels, leading to the secretion of large amounts of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, resulting in profuse, watery diarrhea. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as cholera toxin produces its effect by reducing intracellular levels of cAMP, but in a paradoxical way by inhibiting its degradation.

Options:
A.  Low gastric pH protects against infection
B.  Cholera toxin produces its effect by reducing intracellular levels of cAMP
C.  Fever is usual in adults
D.  Vibrio cholera of the 01 serotype is the only cause of clinical disease.
E.  Responds to therapy with Amoxiclav.

Answer:
D. Vibrio cholera of the 01 serotype is the only cause of clinical disease.

Rationale:
While there are several serotypes of Vibrio cholerae, only those belonging to the O1 serogroup are known to cause clinical cholera in humans. Other serogroups, such as O139, can cause similar symptoms but are not considered true cholera. Therefore, the correct answer is D",B,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.71526694,0.8307153,0.7686805

###Answer:","A. 4months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin; 2 months of ethambutol, Isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide

Rationale:
The correct answer is A. The standard treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is a regimen known as the ""short course"" or ""directly observed therapy"" (DOTS), which consists of 6 months of treatment. The first 2 months of this regimen include isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. The next 4 months include isoniazid and rifampicin. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Explanation:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. TB is treated with a combination of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and prevent the development of drug-resistant strains.

The standard treatment for TB is a regimen known as the ""short course"" or ""directly observed therapy"" (DOTS), which consists of 6 months of treatment. The first 2 months of this regimen include isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. The next 4 months include isoniazid and rifampicin.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: 4 months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin; 2 months of ethambutol, Isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide.

Option B is incorrect because it states that the last 4 months include ethambutol and pyrazinamide instead of isoniazid and rifampicin.

Option C is incorrect because it states that the first 2 months include pyrazinamide and ethambutol instead of ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide.

D.  The provision of HIV testing kits is a priority for good case management
E.  Pulmonary tuberculosis is often associated with HIV infection

###Answer:","E. Pulmonary tuberculosis is often associated with HIV infection

Rationale:
HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are closely linked in Africa, with HIV increasing the risk of TB infection and TB increasing the risk of HIV transmission. HIV weakens the immune system, making it easier for TB bacteria to infect and multiply. Additionally, TB can cause inflammation in the lungs, making it easier for HIV to enter and infect cells. Therefore, HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk for developing TB, and TB is a common presentation of AIDS in Africa. Circumcision is indeed associated with lower rates of HIV infection amongst African men, but this was not the correct answer for this question.

###Answer:","A. Perforation occurring in the first week of typhoid fever has a better prognosis as the patient’s nutritional and immunological status is better

Rationale:
The statement A is not true. The prognosis for patients with typhoid perforation is generally poor, regardless of the duration of illness. The reason is that the perforation itself causes significant morbidity and mortality, and the underlying infection can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure. Early recognition and prompt treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics in an intensive care unit, as well as surgical intervention when necessary, are crucial for improving outcomes. Chloramphenicol is not the drug of choice for typhoid fever, and several surgical options can be considered depending on the patient's condition and the extent of peritoneal soiling.

A.  There is Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia
B.  There is lymphocytic infiltration of hepatic sinusoids
C.  There is very low or absent malarial antibody titers
D.  There is reduced serum IgM
E.  There is unfavorable response to prolonged anti-malarial drug therapy

###Answer:","E. There is unfavorable response to prolonged anti-malarial drug therapy

Rationale:
Tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS) is a clinical condition characterized by splenomegaly, fever, and atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood. It is commonly seen in patients with chronic malarial infections, particularly those with Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium vivax. However, it is important to note that TSS can also occur in the absence of detectable parasitemia.

The presence of splenomegaly and atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood are the hallmark features of TSS. The etiology of TSS is not well understood, but it is believed to be due to an abnormal immune response to the malarial parasite. This response results in the production of large numbers of activated T-cells and monocytes, which infiltrate the spleen and cause splenomegaly.

The treatment of TSS involves the use of anti-malarial drugs to eliminate the underlying malarial infection. However, in some cases, the response to anti-malarial therapy is unfavorable, and the splenomegaly and other symptoms persist despite prolonged treatment. This is the reason why option E is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because TSS can occur in the absence of detectable parasitemia. Option B is incorrect because there is lymphocytic infiltration of hepatic sinusoids, not hepatic sinusoids themselves. Option C is incorrect because malarial antibody titers are usually elevated in patients with TSS. Option D is incorrect because serum IgM levels are usually normal or elevated in patients with TSS.",E,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7241144,0.8449236,0.7798681

###Options:
A.  Addison’s disease
B.  SIADH
C.  Conn’s syndrome
D.  Cushing disease

###Answer:","A. Addison’s disease

Rationale:
The patient’s symptoms of recent onset of grey-brown patches in the mouth and palm, darkening of previous scars, and dizziness on standing are consistent with Addison’s disease. Addison’s disease is a condition characterized by the deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone due to damage to the adrenal glands. The symptoms of Addison’s disease include fatigue, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, and hypoglycemia. The patient’s history of recent travel to Nigeria is also significant as Nigeria is endemic for tuberculosis, which is a common cause of Addison’s disease. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone) and Conn’s syndrome are conditions that cause increased production of aldosterone and cortisol, respectively, and do not present with the symptoms described in the patient.

Rationale:
Insensible water loss refers to the water that is lost from the body through processes other than urination, defecation, or sweating. It includes water loss through the skin due to evaporation and water loss through the lungs during breathing. In a 70 kilogram African man, insensible water loss is estimated to be around 1.5 litres per day. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

###Answer:","D. Total body water in the male is 60% of body weight

Rationale:
In the tropics, due to high temperatures and humidity, there is an increased insensible water loss and sweating, leading to an increased need for fluid and electrolyte replacement. The total body water in an average adult male is approximately 60% of body weight, with intracellular water accounting for about 40% and extracellular water accounting for about 20%.

Rationale:
Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs. In Nigerian children, pneumonia is a common cause of CCF due to the high prevalence of bacterial pneumonia and malnutrition, which can weaken the heart and make it less effective at pumping blood.

Rationale:
Cerebral malaria is a severe form of malaria that affects the brain. The drug of choice for the treatment of cerebral malaria is intravenous artesunate. This is because artesunate is more effective than quinine in reducing the risk of death and the risk of neurological complications in patients with cerebral malaria. The age incidence for cerebral malaria is not limited to 6-10 years, and while convulsions can occur in cerebral malaria, they are not a constant feature.

###Answer:","B. Staphylococcus specie is the commonest aetiology

Rationale:
Pyogenic meningitis is a bacterial infection of the meninges, characterized by inflammation and purulence in the subarachnoid space. Staphylococcus species, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, are the most common causative agents of pyogenic meningitis. Haematogenous spread is a common mode of infection, but other sources such as direct extension from adjacent infections (otitis, sinusitis, etc.) can also occur. Chronic otalgia (long-standing earache) is a risk factor for developing pyogenic meningitis due to the proximity of the middle ear to the meninges. CSF production is not reduced in pyogenic meningitis, but there is an increase in the amount of CSF due to the inflammatory response. Elevated protein in the CSF is due to the inflammatory response and the presence of bacteria, not their destruction.

D.  Trisomy 21
E.  Galactosaemia

###Answer:","C. Concealed haemorrhages

Rationale:
Hyperbilirubinaemia is a common condition in term Nigerian babies, and while there are several causes, concealed haemorrhages are a common cause.

###Answer:","B. Both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation.

Rationale:
Sickle cell disease is a recessive disorder, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. Therefore, both copies of the genes in each cell have mutation. The common misconception that it is a dominant disorder arises because carriers of the sickle cell trait have one normal and one mutated gene, and they may exhibit some symptoms, but they do not develop the full-blown disease. This can lead to the belief that the mutated gene is dominant, but in reality, it is the disease state that is dominant over the normal state.

He smells of kerosene, has a loud grunt, respiratory rate of 96/minute, subcostal recession and bilaterally reduced breath sounds. Which of the following management steps must be avoided?
###Options:
A.  Cardiac positioning
B.  Insertion of venous cannula
C.  Administration of activated charcoal
D.  Gastric lavage

###Answer:","D. Gastric lavage

Rationale:
Given the child's symptoms of sudden breathlessness, smell of kerosene, loud grunt, tachypnea, subcostal recession, and reduced breath sounds, it is highly likely that the child has ingested a significant amount of a petroleum product, such as kerosene. Gastric lavage is a procedure used to empty the stomach contents, which should be avoided in cases of ingestion of petroleum products due to the risk of aspiration and subsequent chemical pneumonitis. Instead, the child should be managed in a well-ventilated area, with oxygen supplementation if necessary, and close observation for signs of respiratory distress. Activated charcoal may be considered for ingestion of certain toxins, but it is not effective for petroleum products. Cardiac positioning and venous cannulas are not directly related to the management of this case.",D,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.76500535,0.859122,0.8093366

Rationale:
Hypothermia is not a clinical manifestation of severe malaria in children.

###Answer:","B. Severe malaria.

Rationale:
The symptoms described in the case presentation are consistent with severe malaria. The presence of fever, poor feeding, dark urine, severe pallor, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly are all common features of severe malaria. The low haematocrit (12%) and low blood pressure (75/60mmHg) are also consistent with severe malaria, which can cause haemolysis and anaemia. Acute glomerulonephritis typically presents with haematuria and oedema, while septicaemia presents with high fever, rapid heart rate, and low blood pressure. Viral hepatitis can cause jaundice and hepatomegaly, but it usually does not cause severe anaemia or splenomegaly.",B,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7291435,0.8735047,0.7948223

###Options:
A.  Point A corresponds to where the uterine artery passes under the ureter
B.  Wertheims hysterectomy involves removal of the ovaries
C.  Brachytherapy is difficult in cancer of the stump of the cervix
D.  Cancer of the cervix is the most common cancer in Nigerian women
E.  Screening every 5 years is recommended

###Answer:","C. Brachytherapy is difficult in cancer of the stump of the cervix

Rationale:
Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, involves the placement of radioactive material near or in the cancerous tissue. In cancer of the cervix, brachytherapy is often used in combination with external beam radiation therapy. However, when the cancer involves the stump of the cervix, it can be difficult to place the radioactive material accurately and safely. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Explanation:
A. Point A corresponds to the area where the uterine artery passes over the internal iliac artery. This is an important landmark in gynecologic surgery, particularly in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.

B. Wertheims hysterectomy is a type of hysterectomy that involves removal of the ovaries and the fallopian tubes, but not the uterus.

D. Cancer of the cervix is not the most common cancer in Nigerian women. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Nigerian women, followed by cervical cancer.

E. Screening for cervical cancer is recommended every 3 years for women between the ages of 21 and 29, and every 5 years for women between the ages of 30 and 65.

###Options:
A.  Request Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate.
B.  Request a Chest X-ray.
C.  Commence anti-tuberculous drugs.
D.  Request BCG vaccine administration.

###Answer:","C. Commence anti-tuberculous drugs.

Rationale:
A positive tuberculin test result (PPD) of 10mm or more in a 10-year old child is considered a strong indication of latent tuberculosis infection. However, a child with a chronic cough and a positive PPD test result is at higher risk for active tuberculosis disease. Therefore, the next important line of action should be to commence anti-tuberculous drugs to prevent progression to active disease and reduce the risk of transmission to others. An Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) test is not necessary as it does not provide any additional diagnostic information in this case. A chest X-ray may be considered if there are clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of active tuberculosis disease, but a negative chest X-ray does not rule out the diagnosis. BCG vaccine administration is not indicated in this case as the child has already been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",C,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7458136,0.8647159,0.80087566
