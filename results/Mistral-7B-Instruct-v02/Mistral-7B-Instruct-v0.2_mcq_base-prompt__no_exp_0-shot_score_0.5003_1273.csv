###Question: A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation.

###Options:
A.  An increase in right atrial pressure
B.  An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
C.  A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential
D.  A reduction in diastolic filling time

###Answer:","A. An increase in right atrial pressure.

Explanation: Standing from a supine position increases the venous return to the heart, which in turn increases the right atrial pressure. This maneuver can help to accentuate a murmur caused by increased right atrial pressure, such as a tricuspid regurgitation murmur. In this case, the mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation is suggestive of tricuspid regurgitation, making option A the correct answer.",A,False

###Options:

B.  Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole
C.  Pericardiocentesis
D.  Pericardiectomy

###Answer:","C. Pericardiocentesis. This patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with pericarditis. The scratching sound heard on auscultation is known as a friction rub, which is a hallmark finding of pericarditis. The ECG shows ST segment elevation, which is also common in pericarditis. The optimal therapy for pericarditis is typically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or indomethacin, but in this case, the patient's symptoms are not improving with these medications, and he requires urgent relief of the pressure in the pericardial sac. Therefore, pericardiocentesis is the appropriate next step in management. Pericardiectomy is a surgical procedure used for chronic or recurrent pericarditis, and it is not the first-line therapy for acute pericarditis. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is not indicated in the treatment of pericarditis.",C,False

A.  Increased interstitial markings
B.  Lobar consolidation in the lingual
C.  Thumbprint sign on the lateral image
D.  Steeple sign

###Answer:","C.  The presence of inspiratory stridor and a barking cough in a child is highly suggestive of a subglottic or tracheal obstruction, such as epiglottitis or a foreign body. A chest X-ray in this setting is unlikely to show any specific findings, and the classic signs of epiglottitis, such as the thumbprint sign or the steeple sign, are not typically seen in this clinical scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is C. There is no option D. The steeple sign is a radiographic finding of a large pleural effusion with a blunting of the costophrenic angle and a sharp, vertical, or ""steeple-like"" appearance of the diaphragm.",C,False

###Question: A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, intermittent rigors, and night sweats. She also has a 1-month history of progressive fatigue. Five weeks ago, she was hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics for treatment of bacterial meningitis while visiting relatives in Guatemala. Her temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae and ecchymoses.

Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was most likely treated with which of the following antibiotics?
###Options:
A.  Doxycycline
B.  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
C.  Linezolid
D.  Chloramphenicol

###Answer:","B. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient's history of bacterial meningitis and travel to Guatemala suggest the possibility of Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae, which are common causes of bacterial meningitis in that region. Both organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but not doxycycline, linezolid, or chloramphenicol.",B,False

The patient's initial presentation with a low potassium level, high glucose level, and metabolic acidosis suggests the possibility of a metformin-induced lactic acidosis. However, the resolution of the metabolic acidosis and improvement in the patient's vital signs after treatment suggests that the initial laboratory values were likely due to a laboratory error.

Explanation: The combination of persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms suggestive of RSV pneumonia in a 3-month-old boy with a low weight suggests an immunodeficiency disease. HIV infection was ruled out by PCR. The most likely cause of these findings is a defective T cell function, which would impair the child's ability to mount an effective immune response against common infections such as RSV and Candida. T cell dysfunction can also lead to persistent diarrhea. Other causes such as grossly reduced levels of B cells, defective isotype switching, and selective IgA deficiency are less likely based on the given symptoms and laboratory results.",A,True

###Options:
A.  0.375
B.  0.5
C.  2.5
D.  2.67

###Answer:","C. 2.5

Explanation:
The therapeutic index is the ratio of the dose that produces a therapeutic effect to the dose that produces a toxic effect. In this case, the therapeutic effect is represented by the number of patients who demonstrated improvement, and the toxic effect is represented by the number of patients who had a treatment related adverse event.

To calculate the therapeutic index for each dose, we can divide the number of patients who demonstrated improvement by the number of patients who had a treatment related adverse event.

For the 20 mg dose: 19/5 = 3.8 (approximately)
For the 40 mg dose: 46/11 = 4.18
For the 60 mg dose: 28/15 = 1.87
For the 80 mg dose: 42/23 = 1.83
For the 100 mg dose: 45/47 = 0.96

The highest therapeutic index is found for the 40 mg dose, with a value of approximately 4.18. However, the question asks for the most likely therapeutic index, which would be the one that is most likely to be observed in clinical practice. Based on the data provided, it is reasonable to assume that the therapeutic index will be higher for doses that have a lower incidence of adverse events. Therefore, the most likely therapeutic index would be the one for the 20 mg dose, which had the second-lowest incidence of adverse events (5/49) and a therapeutic index of approximately 3.8.

However, the correct answer is C, 2.5. This is because the question asks for the most likely therapeutic index based on the given data, and the data only provides the number of patients who demonstrated improvement and the number of patients who had a treatment related adverse event for each dose. Therefore, the only calculation we can make is the ratio of the number of patients who demonstrated improvement to the number of patients who had a treatment related adverse event for each dose. The therapeutic index for the 20 mg dose is 19/5 = 3.8, and the",C,False

###Answer:","D. Aortoiliac artery stenosis. The patient's symptoms of calf cramping and tingling pain in the foot during exercise, along with the absence of right pedal pulses, suggest a vascular cause. Aortoiliac artery stenosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case, as it can cause claudication (pain during exercise) in the calf and foot, and can lead to absent pedal pulses. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis and lumbar spinal stenosis are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms, as they typically do not result in absent pedal pulses. Acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein is also less likely, as it would typically present with swelling and pain in the calf, rather than tingling pain in the foot.",D,False

D.  AFB stain of skin scrapings

###Answer:","D. AFB stain of skin scrapings.

Explanation: The symptoms and physical examination findings described in the question are consistent with a diagnosis of tinea cruris, also known as jock itch. Tinea cruris is a superficial fungal infection caused by dermatophytes. To confirm the diagnosis, a fungal culture or direct microscopic examination of skin scrapings using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or a calcofluor white stain can be performed. However, in this case, the most likely diagnostic test would be a Wood's lamp examination or a direct microscopic examination using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or a calcofluor white stain with a subsequent culture for Aspergillus fumigatus or other filamentous fungi, which can be identified by a positive result on a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain or a silver nitrate stain. Therefore, the correct answer is D. AFB stain of skin scrapings.",D,False

###Answer:","A. Acetaldehyde. Alcohol is metabolized by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, which is then converted to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of anaerobic bacteria by interfering with the electron transport system in the microorganisms. It also inhibits the growth of the normal flora in the vagina, which can lead to an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. However, metronidazole also inhibits the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body.

###Answer:","A. Phentolamine.

Explanation:
The patient presented with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically hematemesis and melena. The endoscopy revealed bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus. This type of bleeding is commonly seen in alcoholics due to esophageal varices caused by portal hypertension. The patient also received IV octreotide in the endoscopy suite, which is a somatostatin analog used to reduce portal hypertension and decrease splanchnic blood flow. Therefore, the indicated pharmacologic agent is phentolamine, a sympathomimetic agent used to decrease portal hypertension by causing systemic vasodilation and decreasing splanchnic blood flow. Phentolamine is often used in combination with terlipressin, another vasoactive agent, to manage variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.",A,False

###Answer:","A. Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with sepsis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), likely due to Escherichia coli. The oliguria and low urine sodium level suggest the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis or SBP. Dopamine is a vasopressor and renal dose dopamine can improve renal perfusion and increase urine output in patients with AKI. Therefore, adding dopamine to his treatment regimen would be the best option for this patient.",A,False

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which is caused by a pituitary tumor that produces excessive amounts of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH stimulates the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands, leading to a range of symptoms including chronic fatigue, weight gain, and muscle weakness. The characteristic chromosomal change associated with Cushing's disease is the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 18, which can result in the overexpression of several genes, including the gene for cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). CDK4 plays a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle, and its overexpression can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division, which may contribute to the development of the pituitary tumor in Cushing's disease. Therefore, the regulation of CDK4 will be most abnormal in this patient.",C,False

###Answer:","C. Acral lentiginous.

Explanation:
The woman's ethnicity (African-American) and family history (uncle with metastatic melanoma) increase her risk for acral lentiginous melanoma, which is more common in darker-skinned individuals and tends to occur on the palms, soles, and under the nails. Desmoplastic melanoma is a rare subtype that typically presents as a firm, painless nodule, while nodular melanoma is a raised, dome-shaped lesion with an irregular border and variable coloration. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common subtype and typically presents as a flat, irregularly shaped lesion with an asymmetrical border and varied coloration.",C,True

B.  Smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium
C.  Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity
D.  Increased secretion of androgens and luteinizing hormone

###Answer:","A. Loss of fallopian tube function following infection.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pelvic and back pain, painful diarrhea, and infertility suggest a possible pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can lead to scarring and blockage of the fallopian tubes, which can result in infertility and chronic pelvic pain. The normal hysterosalpingogram result does not rule out this diagnosis, as it may not detect mild or subtle tubal damage. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is loss of fallopian tube function following infection.",A,False

C.  Laparoscopy
D.  Hysteroscopy

###Answer:","A. Measurement of CA-125 levels.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain and dyspareunia, along with the presence of rectovaginal tenderness, suggest the possibility of endometriosis. However, the negative cervical and urethral swabs and normal transvaginal ultrasonography make other causes, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or malignancy, less likely. Measuring CA-125 levels can help evaluate the possibility of endometriosis or ovarian malignancy. Hysterectomy and hysteroscopy are invasive procedures that are not necessary at this stage, and laparoscopy may not be necessary if CA-125 levels are normal and the patient responds to medical therapy.",A,False

The patient is cyanotic due to the right-to-left shunt through the ventricular septal defect, which allows deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the systemic circulation. The cyanosis is not due to respiratory distress or heart failure, and an elective surgical repair is planned.

The question asks which statement is true about this girl’s condition. The options provided include statements about bacterial endocarditis, hemoglobin levels, and thrombosis.

The correct answer is C. Cerebral arterial thrombosis is more common than cerebral venous thrombosis in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, including tetralogy of Fallot. The increased risk of thrombosis is due to the chronic hypoxemia and hyperviscosity associated with cyanosis. Arterial thrombosis can lead to stroke or other neurological complications.

Therefore, the answer is C.",C,False

###Options:
A.  Autosomal dominant
B.  Autosomal partial dominance
C.  X-linked dominant
D.  X-linked recessive

###Answer:","D. X-linked recessive

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with pulmonary embolism, which is typically caused by a blood clot in the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary embolism can be caused by various factors, including genetic conditions. However, the most common genetic cause of pulmonary embolism is the Factor V Leiden mutation, which is autosomal dominant. However, the patient's test results came back within normal parameters, which makes an autosomal dominant condition less likely. The other options, autosomal partial dominance, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive, are less common causes of pulmonary embolism and are less likely to be the underlying cause in this case. X-linked recessive conditions are characterized by the absence or reduced function of a protein that is produced from a gene located on the X chromosome. Since the patient is a female, she would typically have one normal X chromosome and one affected X chromosome, which would result in some functional protein but not enough to prevent the symptoms of pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is an X-linked recessive condition.",D,False

C.  Supportive therapy and observation
D.  Surgical pinning of the femoral head

###Answer:","C. Supportive therapy and observation.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical exam are consistent with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), which is a common cause of hip pain in adolescents. However, the initial management of a suspected SCFE is supportive therapy and observation in the hospital, as definitive treatment with either a Pavlik harness or surgical pinning depends on the severity and stability of the epiphysis. The patient's vital signs and oxygen saturation are reassuring, and the absence of fever suggests that the epiphysis is not acutely unstable. Therefore, the best management for this patient is supportive therapy and observation.",C,False

###Options:
A.  Anxiety
B.  Diarrhea
C.  Metformin
D.  Sleep apnea

###Answer:","B. Diarrhea.

The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with metabolic acidosis due to diarrhea. The rapid onset of symptoms, decreased appetite, and diarrhea suggest gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate, leading to metabolic acidosis. The lab results show a low bicarbonate level (11 mEq/L) and a pH of 7.25, which is below the normal range of 7.35-7.45. The other options are less likely causes of the changes seen in this patient's labs. Anxiety can cause symptoms such as rapid breathing and palpitations, but it does not typically cause metabolic acidosis. Metformin can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, but it does not typically cause metabolic acidosis unless the patient has renal insufficiency. Sleep apnea can cause metabolic acidosis due to chronic respiratory acidosis, but it does not typically cause the acute symptoms and metabolic acidosis seen in this patient.",B,False

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The presence of multinodular, calcified retinal lesions (also known as ""retinal hamartomas"") is a common finding in TSC. The patient's cognitive delay and seizure disorder are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. TSC1 gene on chromosome 9.",C,True

The patient's symptoms and family history are suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder, specifically Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy. The elevated creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels further support this diagnosis. Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis. Intrafascicular infiltration and perifascicular and perivascular infiltration are findings seen in inflammatory myopathies, not muscular dystrophies.

###Question: A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?
###Options:
A.  Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol
B.  Decreased PTH, increased calcium, increased phosphate, increased calcitriol
C.  Decreased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol
D.  Normal PTH, normal calcium, normal phosphate, normal calcitriol

###Answer:","C. Decreased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol.

Explanation:
Patients with chronic kidney disease, including those with IgA nephropathy, are at risk for developing secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) due to decreased renal production of calcitriol and phosphate clearance. SHPT leads to increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, which in turn leads to decreased calcium levels and increased phosphate levels. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is also decreased due to decreased renal production. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,False

###Question: A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician with her father for evaluation of her short stature. She feels well overall, but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal. Her father reports he had a short stature during his teenage years; he is currently 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?
###Options:
A.  Pelvic ultrasound
B.  Measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels
C.  Reassurance and follow-up
D.  MRI of the brain

###Answer:","C. Reassurance and follow-up.

Explanation: The patient's growth pattern is consistent with constitutional delay of growth and puberty. She is at the 2nd percentile for height and 35th percentile for weight, which is within normal range for her age. Her bone age is delayed, but this is also consistent with constitutional delay. Pelvic ultrasound is not indicated in this case, as it would not provide any additional information. Measuring serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels is not necessary, as this hormone is not involved in constitutional delay. An MRI of the brain is not indicated, as there is no evidence of neurologic disease. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and follow-up.",C,True

###Answer:","D. Tumor arising from epidermal keratinocytes.

Explanation: The description of the patient's condition, including the confluent scaly patches, plaques, and erythroderma, is consistent with psoriasis. However, the presence of a solid skin lesion greater than 1 cm in diameter raises the possibility of a superimposed malignancy, such as squamous cell carcinoma or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided is psoriasis with a superimposed malignancy, which is a rare occurrence. The most accurate description of the underlying condition is psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition arising from epidermal keratinocytes. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,False

###Answer:","C. Yolk sac tumor.

Explanation: The intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid is suggestive of a molar pregnancy. The enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content are characteristic of a functional cystic teratoma or dermoid cyst. However, the presence of a molar pregnancy increases the risk of developing a yolk sac tumor, which can also present with ovarian cysts. Therefore, the most likely cause of the ovarian findings is a yolk sac tumor.",C,False

A venous blood sample obtained for routine screening tests is milky. After refrigeration, a creamy supernatant layer appears on top of the sample.

###Options:
A.  Acute pancreatitis
B.  Myocardial infarction
C.  Corneal arci
D.  Cerebrovascular accident

###Answer:","A. Acute pancreatitis.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with those of a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) caused by a mutation in the APOC2 gene. FH is characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and an increased risk of premature atherosclerosis. However, the milky appearance and creamy supernatant layer of the patient's blood sample suggest the presence of chylomicrons, which are large lipoproteins that carry dietary triglycerides from the intestines to the liver. Chylomicronemia, which is characterized by the presence of large amounts of chylomicrons in the blood, can lead to acute pancreatitis due to the enzymatic digestion of triglycerides in the pancreas. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for developing acute pancreatitis.",A,True

Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. A lumbar puncture is performed and shows an opening pressure of 32 cm H2O (N: < 20). The pathogen isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be cultured on Sabouraud agar. Further evaluation of this patient's CSF is most likely to show which of the following additional findings?
###Options:
A.  Positive latex agglutination test
B.  Positive PCR for HSV-2 DNA
C.  Presence of tachyzoites
D.  Increased adenosine deaminase concentration

###Answer:","B. Positive PCR for HSV-2 DNA.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with meningitis. HIV infection increases the risk of developing bacterial and viral meningitis. The most common cause of HIV-associated meningitis is herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The CSF findings most suggestive of HSV meningitis include a high opening pressure, pleocytosis (>100 cells/mm3), and a predominance of lymphocytes. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by detecting HSV-2 DNA in the CSF using PCR. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,False

B.  Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids
C.  Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol
D.  Increase in serum cortisol

###Answer:","C. Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol.

Explanation:
Metyrapone is a drug that inhibits the enzyme 11β-hydroxylase, which is responsible for the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Therefore, following the administration of metyrapone, there will be a decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol levels. This decrease in 11-deoxycortisol levels leads to an increase in ACTH secretion to stimulate the production of cortisol from the adrenal glands. However, since the patient's adrenal insufficiency was ruled out, the serum cortisol levels should remain normal or elevated. Therefore, option D is incorrect. The patient's urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids will also be decreased due to the inhibition of 11β-hydroxylase, but this was not the question. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.",C,False

B.  580 / (10 + 580)
C.  590 / (590 + 10)
D.  580 / (580 + 20)

###Answer:","D. 580 / (580 + 20)

Explanation:
The specificity of a test is the proportion of true negatives (patients without the disease) among all the negative test results. In this case, the true negatives are the 580 patients without PD who tested negative. The total number of negative test results is 580 (true negatives) + 20 (false negatives). Therefore, the specificity is calculated as follows:

Specificity = True negatives / (True negatives + False negatives)
Specificity = 580 / (580 + 20)
Specificity = 580 / 582
Specificity = 0.9959 or approximately 99.6%

So, the answer is D. 580 / (580 + 20).",D,True

D.  Right-sided analgesia

###Answer:","C. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation, along with the MRI findings of a left C5 hemicord lesion, suggests a cervical spinal cord injury. The most likely finding in this situation is contralateral corticospinal tract involvement, which can result in weakness, sensory loss, or other deficits on the opposite side of the body.

###Answer:","B. Conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with a diagnosis of lead poisoning. Lead interferes with the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, which is responsible for the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen. However, the peripheral blood smear findings are more suggestive of a porphyria, specifically lead-induced acute intermittent porphyria. In this condition, the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, which converts porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane, is impaired. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,False

Her BUN at her last visit 4 months ago was 45 mg/dL, and her creatinine was 2.0 mg/dL. Her laboratory studies this visit are seen below:

Hemoglobin: 8 g/dL
Hematocrit: 29%
Leukocyte count: 9,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 197,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 5.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 17 mEq/L
BUN: 59 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
Ca2+: 9.0 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Acute kidney failure
B.  Chronic kidney failure
C.  Obstructive uropathy
D.  Renal cell carcinoma

###Answer:","B. Chronic kidney failure.

The patient's creatinine level has increased from 2.0 mg/dL to 2.3 mg/dL in just 4 months, indicating a decline in renal function. This is more consistent with chronic kidney failure than acute kidney failure, which would typically present with a much more rapid increase in creatinine. Obstructive uropathy would typically present with symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, and decreased urine output, which the patient does not report. Renal cell carcinoma would typically present with hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable mass, which the patient does not report.",B,True

###Answer:","A. Diabetes.

The most likely drug prescribed in this case is Clomiphene citrate, which is used to stimulate ovulation in women with infertility. However, it also has an off-label use in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and can be used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS. Additionally, Clomiphene citrate has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and can be used to treat infertility in women with PCOS who also have insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. The other options (B, C, and D) are not related to the use of Clomiphene citrate in this context.",A,False

###Options:
A.  Superior mesenteric artery
B.  Inferior mesenteric artery
C.  Celiac artery
D.  Splenic artery

###Answer:","C. Celiac artery.

Explanation:
The celiac artery is the main branch of the abdominal aorta that supplies blood to the abdominal organs, including the kidneys. In normal development, the kidneys ascend superiorly in the abdomen. However, in Turner's syndrome, which is characterized by the absence of one or both X chromosomes, the kidneys may not ascend normally due to various developmental abnormalities. The fusion of the kidney poles inferiorly is a result of this abnormal development and is often caused by the persistent presence of the embryonic ureteric bud, which is supplied by the celiac artery. Therefore, the celiac artery is the anatomical structure that prevents normal ascension of the kidney in this condition.",C,False

Explanation:
The appropriate management for a newly diagnosed CIN I in a young, sexually active woman is close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months. Cryotherapy ablation, LEEP, and hysterectomy are more invasive treatments that are typically reserved for higher-grade lesions or those that do not respond to less invasive treatments. CIN I is considered a low-grade precancerous lesion that often resolves on its own, and the risk of progression to invasive cancer is low. Close observation allows for monitoring of the lesion and early intervention if necessary.",A,True

###Options:
A.  Binding to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor
B.  Closure of ATP-sensitive K-channels in the pancreatic beta-cell
C.  Increased gene expression of GLUT-4
D.  Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist

###Answer:","C. Increased gene expression of GLUT-4.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with heart failure, which can be a complication of long-standing diabetes. The most common medications used to manage type 2 diabetes and prevent complications like heart failure are metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin. However, the patient's history of improved control of her diabetes and the absence of any mention of insulin use suggest that she is most likely taking a medication that increases insulin sensitivity, such as a thiazolidinedione (TZD) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). TZDs work by increasing the gene expression and activity of GLUT-4, a glucose transporter protein, in the muscle and fat cells, making them more responsive to insulin and improving their ability to take up glucose from the bloodstream. GLP-1 RAs, on the other hand, work by mimicking the action of the natural hormone GLP-1, which stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. However, the patient's finger-prick blood glucose level is within normal range, which makes it less likely that she is taking a GLP-1 RA, as these medications typically cause a transient decrease in blood glucose levels after a meal. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Increased gene expression of GLUT-4.",C,True

Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies.

A.  Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges
B.  Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons
C.  Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia
D.  Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes

###Answer:","D. Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question, such as acute agitation, photophobia, dysphagia, and ultimately coma, are consistent with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. The most common causes of viral encephalitis are enteroviruses, which can spread to the CNS through hematogenous dissemination, but they typically do not cause coma or long-term neurological damage. The patient's travel history and the autopsy findings suggest a viral etiology, and the symptoms are not consistent with retrograde migration of a virus up peripheral nerve axons or reactivation of a virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia. Therefore, the most likely answer is D, infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. These cells are the primary targets of many viral encephalitides, including West Nile virus, Zika virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus.",D,False

###Answer:","A. Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles.

This patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a thyroid nodule, and the presence of a family history of medullary thyroid cancer increases the suspicion for this diagnosis. Medullary thyroid cancer is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. The most common histologic finding in fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of medullary thyroid cancer is a diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles. This is in contrast to the more common papillary or follicular thyroid cancers, which typically demonstrate follicular architecture with various degrees of atypia.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with constitutional growth delay, which is a normal variant of growth. The patient's low hairline, broad chest, and Tanner stage I breast development suggest that she may be of short stature due to constitutional growth delay. The absence of Barr bodies on a buccal smear is a diagnostic finding for Turner syndrome, which can also present with short stature and constitutional growth delay. However, the patient's normal karyotype and lack of other features of Turner syndrome make this diagnosis unlikely. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear.",A,True

If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?
###Options:
A.  PPV decreases, NPV decreases
B.  PPV decreases, NPV increases
C.  PPV increases, NPV decreases
D.  PPV unchanged, NPV unchanged

###Answer:","B. PPV decreases, NPV increases.

Explanation:
The positive predictive value (PPV) is the proportion of true positives among all positive test results. The negative predictive value (NPV) is the proportion of true negatives among all negative test results.

In this scenario, the imaging test has a sensitivity of 50% (true positive rate) and a specificity of 99% (true negative rate). The prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population is 40% (20 true positives out of 50 patients).

The PPV is calculated as: PPV = (true positives) / (true positives + false positives) = 20 / (20 + false positives) = 20 / (21) ≈ 0.952

The NPV is calculated as: NPV = (true negatives) / (true negatives + false negatives) = 49 / (49 + false negatives) = 49 / (49 + 1) = 0.99

If the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, the number of true positives will decrease, but the number of false positives will also decrease proportionally since the specificity remains constant. Therefore, both PPV and NPV will decrease but the decrease in PPV will be more pronounced because the number of true positives is decreasing more than the number of false positives.

However, the decrease in false negatives (false negatives = total patients - true positives - true negatives) will be more than the decrease in false positives, resulting in an increase in NPV.

Therefore, the answer is B. PPV decreases, NPV increases.",B,True

###Options:
A.  Macrocytic red blood cells
B.  Hyperchromic red blood cells
C.  Microcytic red blood cells
D.  Bite cells

###Answer:","C. Microcytic red blood cells.

Explanation:
Thalassemia intermedia is a condition characterized by reduced production of hemoglobin due to a mutation in the Beta-globin gene. This leads to microcytic red blood cells, which are smaller than normal, as the mutation affects the translation of the mRNA, resulting in the production of unstable or abnormal hemoglobin molecules. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Microcytic red blood cells.",C,True

###Question: A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by staff of the group home where he resides because of worsening confusion for the past week. He has a history of major depressive disorder and had an ischemic stroke 4 months ago. Current medications are aspirin and sertraline. He is lethargic and disoriented. His pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist oral mucosa, normal skin turgor, and no peripheral edema. While in the waiting room, he has a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L and an elevated serum antidiuretic hormone concentration. Which of the following sets of additional laboratory findings is most likely in this patient?
 $$$ Serum osmolality %%% Urine sodium %%% Serum aldosterone $$$
###Options:
A.  ↓ ↓ ↓
B.  ↑ ↓ normal
C.  ↓ ↑ ↑
D.  ↓ ↑ ↓

###Answer:","C.  ↓ ↑ ↑

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is characterized by the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) leading to water retention, resulting in hyponatremia. However, in this case, the patient also had a seizure, which is a common complication of hyponatremia. The seizure is likely due to the osmotic shift of water into the brain cells, causing cerebral edema. This osmotic shift results in an increase in serum osmolality and urine osmolality, as well as an increase in urine specific gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is C: ↓ ↑ ↑ (decreased serum sodium, increased serum osmolality, and increased urine sodium).",C,False

D.  Reduction in myocardial contractility

###Answer:","C. Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption.

This patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), likely due to left ventricular dysfunction. The medication prescribed for this condition often includes diuretics, which help to reduce the volume overload on the heart by increasing sodium and water excretion. Aldosterone is a hormone that promotes sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased fluid retention and worsening heart failure symptoms. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication is inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption.",C,False

###Answer:","B. Normal epithelium

Explanation:
The mainstem bronchus is lined with ciliated columnar or pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Uniform squamous cells in layers are not a normal finding in this location. However, the option B is the correct answer because the biopsy shows normal epithelium if the cells are uniform squamous cells in layers in the correct location, such as the esophagus or the oral cavity.",B,False

B.  Macule that is 5mm in diameter
C.  Well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders
D.  Itching and pain to palpation

###Answer:","C. Well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders.

Explanation: Melanocytic lesions that are neoplastic in nature, such as melanoma, often present as well-circumscribed papules or nodules with smooth borders. The color can vary from brown-black to red-white, depending on the degree of melanin production and the presence of ulceration or hemorrhage. However, the well-circumscribed and smooth borders are a common feature of melanocytic lesions. Itching and pain to palpation are more commonly associated with non-melanocytic lesions, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. A macule is a flat, pigmented lesion, and a 5mm diameter is not a characteristic feature of melanoma.",C,False

D.  Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins

###Answer:","C. Impaired degradation of β-catenin.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, pale conjunctivae, low hemoglobin concentration, and large polypoid mass in the colon are consistent with colorectal cancer. The biopsy specimen shows no mention of COX-2 expression, and increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine is not directly related to colorectal cancer. However, impaired degradation of β-catenin is a common mechanism in colorectal cancer, leading to the uncontrolled growth and proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.

###Options:
A.  Abundant reticulocytes
B.  Linear aggregations of red blood cells
C.  Schistocytes
D.  Leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells

###Answer:","C. Schistocytes.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with renal failure due to a renal disease called membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), which is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli leading to inflammation and damage. The large eosinophilic casts seen on renal biopsy are a hallmark of MPGN.

On peripheral blood smear, schistocytes are the most likely finding in patients with MPGN. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells that result from mechanical damage to red blood cells as they pass through the damaged glomeruli. This damage leads to the release of free hemoglobin into the circulation, which can cause anemia and other complications.

Therefore, the answer is C. Schistocytes.",C,False

D.  Short acting beta-2 agonist

###Answer:","D. Short acting beta-2 agonist.

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with allergic rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis. The medication prescribed for these conditions is typically a short-acting beta-2 agonist, such as albuterol, which acts by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and increasing airflow to the lungs. It can also have a bronchodilatory effect in the nasal passages, leading to relief of nasal congestion and improved breathing through the nose. This mechanism of action is different from that of alpha-adrenergic agonists, which constrict blood vessels, or muscarinic receptor antagonists, which block the effects of acetylcholine. Disulfide bonds are not directly related to the mechanism of action of these medications.",D,False

B.  Liquefication of the vitreous body
C.  Increased ciliary muscle tone
D.  Increased lens elasticity

###Answer:","C. Increased ciliary muscle tone.

Explanation: The patient's reported improvement in vision and the finding of normal fundoscopy with microaneurysms suggest that the patient may have had a spontaneous improvement in their refractive error, which is most likely due to an increase in ciliary muscle tone. This can occur in some individuals with diabetes, and it can lead to a decrease in the need for corrective lenses. The other options are not related to this scenario.",C,False

###Answer:","C. Persistent depressive disorder. The patient's history of multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty, along with the absence of manic or hypomanic episodes, is most consistent with Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), also known as Dysthymia. The patient's recent episode of increased energy and impulsivity, along with the guilt and sadness that followed, could represent a depressive episode within the context of PDD. The presence of a past history of meningoencephalitis and the reported hallucinations during that episode do not change the diagnosis, as they are not directly related to the patient's current depressive symptoms.",C,False

###Answer:","D. Lower extremity doppler.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The first step in the management of suspected PE is to evaluate for DVT. A lower extremity doppler ultrasound is the initial diagnostic test of choice for suspected DVT. If the doppler ultrasound is positive for DVT, anticoagulation therapy is initiated. If the doppler ultrasound is negative, further evaluation with a ventilation-perfusion scan or CT angiogram may be considered. In this case, given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a lower extremity doppler ultrasound is the best course of management at this time.",D,False

The patient states that he just arrived in the United States to live with his wife, with whom he is monogamous.

C.  Cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes
D.  Is a common cause of septic arthritis in this patient’s age group

###Answer:","C. Cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of bubo-mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is a characteristic finding in the secondary stage of syphilis. The presence of a painless chancre (option B) would suggest primary syphilis, which is not the case here. Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine (option A) is not applicable to syphilis, as there is no vaccine available for this disease. Septic arthritis (option D) is not a common cause of this presentation in a 22-year-old man. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,False

B.  Decrease in systemic vascular resistance
C.  Increase in cardiac output
D.  Increase in blood volume

###Answer:","B. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a large shunt, such as a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which causes a decrease in systemic vascular resistance during pregnancy. The increase in blood volume and cardiac output in pregnancy can worsen the shunt and lead to increased cyanosis and dyspnea.",B,True

###Options:
A.  Clonidine
B.  Diazepam taper
C.  Haloperidol and diphenhydramine
D.  Oseltamivir

###Answer:","C. Haloperidol and diphenhydramine.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe diarrhea, malaise, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, dilated pupils, and difficulty placing an IV are suggestive of a serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity in the body. The patient's history of fibromyalgia increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Haloperidol and diphenhydramine are commonly used to treat serotonin syndrome due to their anticholinergic and antihistamine properties, respectively, which help to counteract the symptoms of serotonin excess. Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 agonist used to treat hypertension and withdrawal symptoms from opioids, and it is not indicated for the treatment of serotonin syndrome. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and muscle spasms, and it is not specifically indicated for the treatment of serotonin syndrome. Oseltamivir is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza.",C,False

B.  Change treatment to lithium
C.  Continue current therapy
D.  Electroconvulsive therapy

###Answer:","C. Continue current therapy.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms suggest a major depressive episode. The first-line treatment for major depressive disorder is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The patient has been started on appropriate first-line therapy and given 1 week to respond. If the symptoms have not improved after 1 week, it is recommended to continue the current therapy for a longer trial period before considering a change in treatment. Adding lithium or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are typically considered as second-line or third-line treatments for major depressive disorder.",C,True

The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Raynaud's phenomenon
B.  Myocardial infarction
C.  Aortic dissection
D.  Costochondritis

###Answer:","C. Aortic dissection. The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with aortic dissection, which can cause transient ST elevations. Raynaud's phenomenon and costochondritis are not associated with chest pain mechanisms that cause ST elevations. Myocardial infarction can also cause ST elevations, but the patient's lack of association with exertion and normal EKG in the office make it less likely.",C,False

###Answer:","A. Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum.

The patient's symptoms, contact history, and rash are consistent with rubella infection. The high IgG avidity and previous IgG level suggest that the patient had a past infection. However, since her IgG level is not fourfold higher than her previous level, it is unclear if she has developed immunity. The presence of IgM indicates a recent infection, but the low level and high avidity suggest that the IgM may be a result of the recent boosting of her immune response. Therefore, it is recommended that she receive the rubella vaccine postpartum to ensure protection for future pregnancies. There is no need for pregnancy termination or additional testing for parvovirus B19.",A,False

""

###Answer:","D.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results are consistent with a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a type of liver cancer. The most common cause of HCC is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which can lead to the integration of viral DNA into the host genome. This integration can result in the development of malignant cells. Therefore, the most likely underlying pathogenesis of this patient's condition is option D: Integration of foreign DNA into the host genome.",D,True

###Options:
A.  ↑ serum transferrin receptors
B.  ↑ transferrin saturation
C.  Upregulation of hepcidin
D.  ↑ reticulocyte count

###Answer:","E.  Microcytic anemia.

Explanation:
The patient's microcytic anemia is indicated by a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL. This finding, along with the patient's fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath, suggests that she has anemia due to iron deficiency. The other laboratory findings, such as a low hemoglobin level, reticulocytosis, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The options provided do not directly answer the question, but they can be used to help understand the underlying causes of the patient's anemia.

Option A is incorrect because transferrin receptors are upregulated in conditions where there is increased demand for iron, such as in inflammation or during erythropoiesis. In iron deficiency anemia, transferrin receptors are downregulated due to the lack of available iron.

Option B is incorrect because transferrin saturation is decreased in iron deficiency anemia due to the lack of available iron to bind to transferrin.

Option C is incorrect because hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron homeostasis by inhibiting the absorption of dietary iron and promoting the internalization of iron from macrophages. In iron deficiency anemia, hepcidin levels are typically low, which allows for increased absorption of dietary iron.

Option D is incorrect because reticulocyte count is increased in conditions where there is increased erythropoiesis, such as in anemia due to blood loss or in response to erythropoietin therapy. In iron deficiency anemia, the reticulocyte count is typically low due to the lack of available iron for erythropoiesis.",,False

Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
B.  Biliary cyst
C.  Intestinal malrotation
D.  Pancreas divisum

###Answer:","C. Intestinal malrotation.

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with intestinal malrotation, which is characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, and a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. The pain is often intermittent and can be mistaken for appendicitis. The older sister's diagnosis of congenital heart disease is not related to the patient's symptoms. Intestinal malrotation is a congenital condition where the intestines do not form properly during fetal development, resulting in a malpositioned intestine and a twisted intestine, which can obstruct the blood flow to the intestine and cause ischemia. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a condition where the muscle in the pylorus becomes thickened, obstructing the flow of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Biliary cyst is a rare condition where a cyst forms in the biliary tree, and pancreas divisum is a congenital condition where the pancreas does not fully separate into the head and body during fetal development, resulting in a persistent connection between the two parts of the pancreas.",C,False

###Options:
A.  Mevalonate
B.  Acetoacetyl-CoA
C.  Diacyglycerol
D.  High-density lipoprotein

###Answer:","C. Diacyglycerol.

Explanation: Atorvastatin is a statin medication that inhibits the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, which is involved in the production of mevalonate, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. By inhibiting this enzyme, statins increase the expression of LDL receptors on the liver cells, leading to an increase in LDL uptake and clearance from the blood. This results in a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. However, statins also have pleiotropic effects, such as decreasing the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), which is a key player in the activation of protein kinase C and the production of inflammatory cytokines. This decrease in DAG production leads to a reduction in inflammation and an improvement in endothelial function. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Diacyglycerol.",C,False

C.  Parietal cells
D.  Smooth muscle

###Answer:","C. Parietal cells.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with pernicious anemia, which is caused by autoimmune destruction of parietal cells in the stomach. Parietal cells produce intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. The absence of intrinsic factor leads to malabsorption of vitamin B12, resulting in macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms such as tingling in the feet and poor balance. The histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa, which is consistent with chronic atrophic gastritis, a hallmark of pernicious anemia. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Parietal cells.",C,True

###Answer:","C. ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of frequent urination with large volume and increased thirst despite low urine osmolality suggest a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), which is caused by resistance to the action of ADH in the renal collecting ducts. The low urine osmolality in the presence of a normal or low serum osmolality is consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,True

A.  Plays a role in angioedema
B.  Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor
C.  Creates pores in the cell membrane
D.  Induces the alternative complement pathway

###Answer:","D. Induces the alternative complement pathway.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, which is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection. The fact that she reports using safe sex practices but still contracted the infection suggests that she may have an underlying immune deficiency. The complement system is a key part of the innate immune response, and a deficiency in the alternative complement pathway can result in recurrent Neisseria infections. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,False

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?
###Options:
A.  Alcohol-induced liver injury
B.  Immune response to streptococcal infection
C.  Intestinal IgA deficiency
D.  Protein deposition

###Answer:","B. Immune response to streptococcal infection.

Explanation:
The patient's history of recent impetigo infection, along with the positive urine culture for cocaine and marijuana, and the presence of guaiac-positive stools, suggest an ongoing infection. The laboratory findings, including a low hematocrit, normal white blood cell count with a normal differential, and elevated liver enzymes, are consistent with an acute hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury. However, the normal bilirubin levels and the absence of jaundice argue against a drug-induced liver injury. The positive urine protein and the low serum creatinine level suggest a glomerular source of proteinuria, which is not consistent with an alcohol-induced liver injury. Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings is an immune response to a streptococcal infection.",B,False

###Options:
A.  Medication side effect
B.  Excess weight
C.  Infection
D.  Occult malignancy

###Answer:","B. Excess weight.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including knee pain, morning stiffness, and crepitus, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA), which is commonly associated with obesity. The patient's obesity, as indicated by his high BMI, is a significant risk factor for OA. The patient's history of NSAID use and response, as well as the absence of redness or warmth, makes infection less likely. The patient's fatigue and daytime sleepiness are also consistent with obesity-related conditions, such as sleep apnea or metabolic disorders. The family history of RA does not fit with the patient's presentation, as RA typically presents with a different pattern of symptoms and does not have the same association with obesity. Therefore, the underlying cause of the patient's pain and other complaints is excess weight.",B,True

###Options:
A.  CN X
B.  CN VII
C.  CN IX
D.  CN V

###Answer:","C. CN IX.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of dysphagia for both solids and liquids, along with the presence of a small outpouching in the posterior neck on swallowing study, are indicative of a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. This condition is most commonly associated with impaired function of the circopharyngeus muscle, which is innervated by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X). However, the patient's symptoms do not include speech-related pain or nasal regurgitation, which are more suggestive of a CN X lesion. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a pharyngeal pouch, which is caused by a weakness or deficiency of the cricopharyngeus muscle, leading to a protrusion of the mucosal lining of the pharynx into the esophagus. This condition is most commonly associated with impaired function of the inferior constrictor muscle, which is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Therefore, the most likely nerve involved in this patient's symptoms is CN IX.",C,False

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and feeling cold, along with the findings of a stony hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland, low radioactive iodine uptake on scanning, and normal TSH and low T4 levels, are consistent with silent thyroiditis, also known as subacute thyroiditis. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland, leading to the release of stored thyroid hormones and subsequent transient hypothyroidism. It is important to note that this diagnosis should be confirmed with further testing, such as thyroid antibody levels, as other conditions, such as Graves' disease, can also present with similar symptoms.",D,False

###Options:
A.  Needlestick
B.  Unprotected sex
C.  Shellfish
D.  Acetaminophen overdose

###Answer:","A or B

Explanation:
The presence of both Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies indicates an acute infection with both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A. The most common modes of transmission for both viruses are through contact with infected blood or body fluids (needlestick) or through sexual contact. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is either a needlestick injury or unprotected sex. Shellfish consumption is a common cause of Hepatitis A infection, but it would not explain the presence of Hepatitis B antibodies. Acetaminophen overdose would not cause the presentation described and would not result in the detection of Hepatitis B or Hepatitis A antibodies.",A,False

B.  Hyperprolactinemia
C.  Impaired migration of GnRH neurons
D.  Decreased thyroxine production

###Answer:","C. Impaired migration of GnRH neurons.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of impaired sense of smell (anosmia), short stature, and delayed puberty suggest Kallmann syndrome, which is caused by impaired migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from the olfactory bulb to the hypothalamus. This results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. The other options are not related to the patient's symptoms.",C,True

B.  It has a granuloma with Anitchov cells around a core of fibrinoid collagen necrosis.
C.  It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.
D.  This type of granulomatous inflammation is also seen in histoplasmosis.

###Answer:","C. It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with a chronic lung infection, such as tuberculosis. The differential count with a predominance of lymphocytes and a normal or slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is also consistent with tuberculosis. The presence of consolidation on chest radiograph further supports this diagnosis.

Granulomatous inflammation is a common feature of tuberculosis. The type of granuloma seen in tuberculosis is characterized by a largely circumscribed lesion with epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,True

###Answer:","B. Herniated nucleus pulposus.

The patient's symptoms of worsening back pain with numbness and weakness in the legs, which are improved with activities such as riding a bike or pushing a cart, are suggestive of a herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). The fact that the patient has a history of osteoporosis, which puts him at increased risk for compression fractures, makes this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, the normal mobility in all directions of the spine and normal radiography results further support the diagnosis of HNP.",B,False

Explanation:
The patient's dry cough is not a common side effect of lisinopril, atorvastatin, or metformin. However, it is a known side effect of albuterol inhaler and citalopram. Since the patient's vitals signs are stable and there are no signs of angioedema or respiratory distress, changing the albuterol inhaler to a long-acting beta-agonist or leukotriene modifier may be considered as a first step in management.

###Answer:","C. Hemolytic uremic syndrome. The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and peripheral blood smear are consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection. HUS is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The positive stool test for occult blood, normal Coomb's test, and negative fibrin split products further support this diagnosis. HELLP syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are other conditions that can present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, but they have distinct clinical and laboratory features that differ from the case presented here. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is less likely due to the negative Coomb's test.",C,False

C.  Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: no change
D.  Muscle relaxation time: no change, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased

###Answer:","B. Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.

Explanation: The ATP2A1 gene encodes for a calcium ATPase pump that is responsible for pumping calcium ions from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle relaxation. A mutation in this gene results in a loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, leading to an inability to effectively remove calcium ions from the cytosol during muscle relaxation. This results in an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, which in turn leads to muscle contraction and increased muscle relaxation time.",B,True

###Question: A 81-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell asleep at the dinner table and was not able to be roused by his family. His past medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease though he is still relatively functional at baseline. He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus. After determining the cause of this patient's symptoms, his physicians begin monitoring his international normalized ratio, because they are concerned that it will start trending down. Which of the following treatments would most improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Ammonium chloride
B.  Mannitol
C.  Sodium bicarbonate
D.  Thiazide diuretics

###Answer:","A. Ammonium chloride.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are likely due to ingestion of phenytoin, which is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Ammonium chloride increases urinary pH, which can enhance phenytoin excretion. The other options do not have this effect.",A,False

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants

A.  Inhibits cell wall synthesis
B.  Binds D-ala D-ala in the cell wall
C.  Inhibits initiation complex
D.  Inhibits sterol synthesis

###Answer:","A. Inhibits cell wall synthesis.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI), likely caused by E. coli, a common gram-negative bacterium. The antibiotics commonly used to treat UTIs are those that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, or fluoroquinolones. Since the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not an option. Nitrofurantoin is typically used for uncomplicated UTIs and may not be effective against more severe infections. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics and are not the first-line treatment for UTIs. Therefore, the most likely antibiotic the patient was treated with is a fluoroquinolone, which inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. However, since the question asks for the mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with, the answer is A, Inhibits cell wall synthesis.",A,True

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, history of smoking, and physical examination findings (enlarged fingertips and curved nails, known as digital clubbing) are consistent with chronic thoracic obstructive disease (COPD). However, the CT scan findings of clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung are more suggestive of interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

B.  DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP
C.  DIP has more neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP
D.  DIP and PIP have similar numbers of neutrophils and monocytes

###Answer:","D. DIP and PIP have similar numbers of neutrophils and monocytes.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, which is characterized by synovitis and an inflammatory response in the affected joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the synovial fluid in the affected joints typically shows an increased number of white blood cells, with a predominance of neutrophils in the acute phase and a shift to monocytes in the chronic phase. However, in the early stages of the disease, the synovial fluid may have similar numbers of neutrophils and monocytes. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,False

Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes
B.  Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase
C.  Decreased proteolysis
D.  Increased lipoprotein lipase activity

###Answer:","C. Decreased proteolysis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by decreased insulin levels leading to increased lipolysis and ketogenesis. Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins, and decreased proteolysis is not a feature of DKA. The other options are related to lipid metabolism, which is affected in DKA due to increased lipolysis and ketogenesis.",C,False

###Answer:","A. Spironolactone or B. Eplerenone. Both Spironolactone and Eplerenone are aldosterone receptor antagonists, but Spironolactone has additional mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist activity, which may increase the risk of gynecomastia. Eplerenone has a lower risk of gynecomastia compared to Spironolactone, but it may have a higher risk of impotence. The choice between the two depends on the relative importance of these side effects for the individual patient. In this case, since the patient is more concerned about impotence, B. Eplerenone would be the better option. However, if the patient is more concerned about gynecomastia, A. Spironolactone may be the better option despite the higher risk of gynecomastia.",A,False

###Question: An 11-year-old boy presents to your office with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours. You suspect that this patient has experienced a loss of polyanions in his glomerular basement membranes. Which of the following findings would confirm your diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  WBC casts in the urine
B.  Selective albuminuria
C.  Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine
D.  Bence-Jones proteinuria

###Answer:","A. WBC casts in the urine.

Explanation: The presence of WBC casts in the urine indicates glomerulonephritis, which is characterized by the loss of polyanions from the glomerular basement membrane. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier, resulting in proteinuria and edema. Other causes of proteinuria, such as selective albuminuria, negatively birefringent crystals, and Bence-Jones proteinuria, do not involve the loss of polyanions from the glomerular basement membrane.",A,False

###Options:
A.  Digoxin blood level
B.  PR interval
C.  Age
D.  Amiodarone blood level

###Answer:","C. Age.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with hyperthyroidism, likely Graves' disease. The irregular heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which is common in hyperthyroidism. Age is a strong positive correlation for atrial fibrillation, as the risk increases with age. Digoxin and amiodarone are medications used to treat heart rhythm disorders, but they are not strongly correlated with atrial fibrillation in this patient. The PR interval is a measure of the time it takes for an electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricles, and is not directly related to atrial fibrillation.",C,True

###Question: A 27-year-old male suddenly develops severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea. The patient reports consuming undercooked ground beef four days prior to the onset of the symptoms. Which of the following best describes the toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process?
###Options:
A.  Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death
B.  Increased pH of gastrointestinal lumen resulting in reduced mucosal absorption
C.  Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract
D.  Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells

###Answer:","C. Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with foodborne illness caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). STEC produces a potent toxin called Shiga toxin, which inhibits the synthesis of a key enzyme in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the intestinal cells. This leads to a decrease in absorption and an increase in secretion, resulting in diarrhea. The toxin does not directly affect actin filaments, alter the pH of the gastrointestinal lumen, or inhibit protein synthesis in the ribosomes. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,False

###Answer:","D. Wilson disease. The patient's recent travel history, intermittent nausea and vomiting, weakness, back/leg pain, and flattened T waves on EKG are all suggestive of Wilson disease. Thiazides can be used to treat hypertension in Wilson disease, but they can also worsen the disease by increasing urinary copper excretion. Therefore, it is important to be aware of this association. Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that can cause liver damage, neurological symptoms, and psychiatric disturbances.

###Options:
A.  Broad ligament
B.  Ovarian ligament

D.  Infundibulopelvic ligament

###Answer:","C. Cardinal ligament.

Explanation:
The cardinal ligament is the ligament that attaches the uterus to the pelvic sidewall and the ovarian fossa. It is the primary source of blood supply to the ovary via the ovarian artery. The sudden onset of severe right flank pain with tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant, along with the absence of flow in the right ovarian vein, suggests torsion of the right ovary. Torsion can lead to vascular compromise, resulting in ischemia and infarction of the ovary. The cardinal ligament is the most likely ligament to be involved in this scenario, as it is the ligament that allows for the greatest degree of rotation of the ovary.",C,False

###Question: A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-α is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?
###Options:
A.  Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
B.  DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
C.  DNA gyrase
D.  Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase

###Answer:","C. DNA gyrase.

Explanation: The additional drug in the therapy for hepatitis C is often ribavirin, which inhibits the replication of hepatitis C virus by inhibiting the RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase. However, the question asks for the effect of the additional drug on the enzyme inhibited by interferon-α, which is DNA gyrase. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,False

C.  Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability
D.  Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants

###Answer:","D. Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.

Explanation:
Capsular polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates that are difficult for the immune system to recognize and produce an effective response against. By conjugating these polysaccharides to a protein carrier, such as tetanus toxoid, the immune system is able to mount a more robust and long-lasting immune response, particularly in infants and young children. This is because the conjugated vaccine stimulates the production of both IgG and IgM antibodies, which provide both short-term and long-term protection against the targeted bacterial infections. Therefore, the best answer to the question is D. Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.",D,True

###Options:
A.  Decreased complement levels
B.  Increased anti-centromere antibodies
C.  Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies
D.  Increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies

###Answer:","A. Decreased complement levels.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a diagnosis of rosacea, an inflammatory condition of the skin that primarily affects the face. Rosacea is more common in individuals with fair skin and a northern European ancestry. Decreased complement levels are not a feature of rosacea, but they are often seen in systemic lupus erythematosus, another condition that can present with facial rash and joint pain. However, the patient's lack of other systemic symptoms and normal laboratory values make systemic lupus less likely. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, decreased complement levels, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer is C. Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, which are often seen in rheumatoid arthritis, another condition that can present with joint pain and a rash, but the patient's lack of other joint symptoms and normal laboratory values make rheumatoid arthritis less likely. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are most consistent with rosacea.",A,True

A.  Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release
B.  Inhibition of serotonin reuptake
C.  Stimulation of norepinephrine release
D.  Inhibition of lipase

###Answer:","D. Inhibition of lipase.

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with pancreatic steatorrhea, which is a common side effect of lipase inhibitors. These medications work by reducing the amount of lipase in the digestive tract, which in turn prevents the breakdown of dietary fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed in the intestines. The undigested fats then pass through the intestines and are excreted in the stool, leading to greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. The night-time vision problems and dry, scaly skin are unrelated to the medication and may be due to other underlying conditions. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking is inhibition of lipase.",D,True

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by demyelination of peripheral nerves. The most common subtype of GBS is the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) type. The diagnosis of GBS is typically confirmed by the presence of specific antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as anti-GM1 or anti-GD1a antibodies. The CSF analysis in this patient is likely to show an elevated protein level and the presence of oligoclonal bands on immunofixation, which further supports the diagnosis of GBS.

However, the patient's history does not indicate any known allergies, and the reaction occurred after a blood transfusion, which suggests an immunodeficiency disorder. One possible immunodeficiency disorder that can cause allergic reactions to blood products is Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), which is characterized by low levels of IgG and IgA, and normal or elevated IgM levels. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Another possible immunodeficiency disorder that can cause allergic reactions to blood products is Selective IgA Deficiency, which is characterized by low levels of IgA and normal levels of IgG and IgM. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Option C is incorrect because high IgE levels are not typically associated with immunodeficiency disorders. Option D is incorrect because the patient's symptoms suggest an underlying immunodeficiency disorder, and normal serum immunoglobulin values would be unlikely in this case.",B,True

C.  Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle
D.  Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle

###Answer:","D. Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle.

Explanation: The structure described in the question is most likely the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), which runs from the posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle to the anterior aspect of the lateral tibial plateau. The PCL prevents posterior translation of the tibia on the femur. The inability to pull the knee anteriorly in 90 degrees of flexion is a common finding in PCL injuries.",D,True

C.  Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance
D.  Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance

###Answer:","D. Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and exam findings are consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), which is characterized by increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and decreased cardiac output. This leads to an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (Aa gradient), decreased lung compliance (decreased surface area for diffusion), and increased diffusion distance due to edema in the lungs. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D,True

She notices that at work if she does not take regular bathroom breaks her underwear will have some urine in it. She urinates 5 to 11 times per day but she claims it is a small volume. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine. Her temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization
B.  Bethanechol during the day and oxybutynin at night
C.  No recommendations needed
D.  Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics

###Answer:","D. Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of frequent urination with small volume and incontinence, especially in the context of a high blood pressure reading and decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities, suggest the possibility of a neurogenic bladder or detrusor instability. However, the presence of a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border raises the possibility of heart failure as a contributing factor to her symptoms. Reducing fluid intake and discontinuing diuretics may help alleviate her symptoms by decreasing urine production and reducing the amount of urine she needs to hold in her bladder. This approach may also help improve her blood pressure and reduce the workload on her heart. Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization are not the best initial treatments for this patient, as they do not address the underlying cause of her symptoms. Oxybutynin is not recommended for use at night due to the risk of urinary retention during sleep. No recommendations are not appropriate given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.",D,False

###Question: A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician with a lump on her throat that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and lab results are consistent with acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC), which is characterized by sudden onset of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, often precipitated by a trigger such as trauma, surgery, or certain medications. AAC is typically associated with a lower leukocyte count and lower transaminase levels compared to acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), and the absence of gallstones on ultrasound. The ultrasound image provided does not show gallstones, which further supports the diagnosis of AAC. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,False

D.  Begin warfarin and heparin

###Answer:","A. Begin aspirin therapy.

Explanation: The patient has a history of ischemic stroke and is at high risk for future CVAs. Aspirin is the first-line therapy for stroke prevention in most patients. Clopidogrel may be considered in certain situations, such as after endovascular therapy or in patients with a high risk of recurrent ischemic events, but it is not the most appropriate intervention in this case. Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure used to remove plaque from the carotid artery and is not indicated in this patient based on the information provided. Warfarin and heparin are anticoagulants used to prevent blood clots and are not the most appropriate intervention for stroke prevention in this patient.",A,False

B.  Subsolid component
C.  Extending fine striations
D.  Doubling time of < 1 month

###Answer:","A. 'Popcorn' pattern.

Explanation: The presence of a 'popcorn' pattern on CT scans is a characteristic finding of malignant pulmonary nodules. This finding, along with other factors such as size growth, and certain imaging features, can help distinguish malignant from benign nodules. Therefore, the identification of a 'popcorn' pattern on a CT scan of a pulmonary nodule the same size as the one in this patient would most likely prompt the removal of the nodule for further evaluation.",A,False

C.  Antibodies directed against endothelial cells
D.  Vitamin K deficiency

###Answer:","B. Antibodies directed against phospholipids.

This patient's presentation is consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the blood. The aPL are autoantibodies that bind to phospholipids on the surface of platelets, endothelial cells, and other tissues. These antibodies can activate the coagulation cascade, leading to thrombosis. The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a previous spontaneous abortion increase the likelihood of APS as the underlying cause of her DVT. The prolonged PT and PTT, along with a normal mixing study, are also consistent with the diagnosis of APS. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is B. Antibodies directed against phospholipids.",B,True

D.  Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months

###Answer:","B. Treat with three weekly infections of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.

Explanation:
The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of syphilis and HIV. Syphilis can cause neurological complications, and the absence of neurological symptoms does not rule out the possibility of CNS involvement. Therefore, a lumbar puncture is not the most appropriate next step in management at this time. The patient should be treated for syphilis with three weekly injections of penicillin, and titers should be obtained 3 months after completion of treatment to ensure adequate response.",B,False

###Answer:","C. Hydrocortisone.

The patient's symptoms of double vision worsening in the evenings, mild ptosis, and a family history of autoimmune conditions suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, making it the most appropriate medication for this patient. Pyridostigmine and physostigmine are cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat myasthenia gravis, but they do not address the underlying cause of the condition. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant used to treat autoimmune conditions, but it may take several weeks to see a therapeutic effect.",C,False

###Answer:","D. L cells.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is caused by deficiencies in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. The patient's hypogonadism and delayed development suggest this diagnosis. The cause of the patient's overweight condition is related to this condition, specifically due to elevated levels of gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin, which is produced by L cells in the stomach.

###Options:
A.  Convergent validity
B.  Discriminant validity
C.  Negative predictive value
D.  Test specificity

###Answer:","C.  Negative predictive value.

Explanation: Lowering the cut-off point for tuberculin skin testing from 5 mm to 4 mm would result in an increase in the negative predictive value (NPV), meaning that a smaller number of false positives would be identified. This is because a lower cut-off point would result in a larger number of people being classified as negative, even if they may have a latent TB infection. However, it is important to note that a lower cut-off point would also result in an increase in the number of false negatives, which could potentially lead to missed cases of TB. Therefore, the decision to lower the cut-off point should be carefully considered in the context of the specific population being screened and the resources available for follow-up testing and treatment.",C,True

###Answer:","D. Continue normal breast feeding.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the question are consistent with jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. The cause of jaundice in this case is likely to be breast milk jaundice, which is not a cause for concern and does not require any specific treatment. Continuing normal breast feeding is the best course of action. Phenobarbital and plasma exchange are used to treat other forms of jaundice, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, which is a more serious condition.

###Question: A researcher is conducting an experiment on the mouse kidney to study the relative concentrations between the tubular fluid and plasma of a number of substances along the proximal convoluted tubule. Based on the graph shown in figure A, which of the following best describes the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea?
###Options:
A.  B
B.  C
C.  D
D.  E

###Answer:","C

Explanation:
The tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of a substance is the ratio of the concentration of that substance in the tubular fluid to its concentration in the plasma. In this question, the researcher is studying the relative concentrations of urea along the proximal convoluted tubule, and the graph shows the concentrations of urea in the tubular fluid and plasma at various points along the tubule.

To determine the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea, we need to compare the concentrations of urea in the tubular fluid and plasma at the same point along the tubule. The point of interest is where the tubular fluid and plasma concentrations are equal, which is indicated by the intersection of the two lines on the graph.

At this point, the concentrations of urea in both the tubular fluid and plasma are the same, so the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio is 1:1. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Note:
It is important to carefully read the question and options before answering, as the correct answer may not always be intuitive. In this case, the question asks for the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio, which is the ratio of the concentration of a substance in the tubular fluid to its concentration in the plasma, not the difference between the concentrations or the absolute concentrations.",C,False

B.  Decreased progesterone
C.  Increased follicle stimulating hormone
D.  Increased progesterone

###Answer:","C. Increased follicle stimulating hormone.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with a pituitary tumor, specifically a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas are associated with an elevated serum prolactin level, which can lead to galactorrhea (milk production in the absence of lactation) and headaches. The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is a pituitary microadenoma, which results in an overproduction of prolactin due to an increase in the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased follicle stimulating hormone.",C,False

###Options:
A.  Arachnoid villi
B.  Interventricular foramen
C.  Median aperture
D.  Lateral apertures

###Answer:","C. Median aperture.

Explanation:
The median aperture is the structure that connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle in the brain. Blockage of this structure can lead to isolated dilation of the lateral ventricle, as seen in this case. The arachnoid villi are a part of the arachnoid membrane and help in the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. The interventricular foramen is an opening between the left and right lateral ventricles, and the lateral apertures are openings between the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle.",C,False

Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray
B.  Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
C.  Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound
D.  Tripple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray

###Answer:","C. Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with pyloric stenosis, which is a common condition in infants with Down syndrome. Pyloric stenosis is characterized by hypertrophy and thickening of the pylorus muscle, leading to obstruction of the pylorus and vomiting after feeds. Therefore, the most likely diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis is an abdominal ultrasound, which will show an elongated and thickened pylorus. Other tests such as abdominal x-ray or EIA for rotavirus antigen are not the most appropriate diagnostic tests for this condition.",C,True

###Question: A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes insulin. He complains of frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep. When he wakes up, he feels excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness.

###Options:
A.  Reassurance
B.  Adding pramlintide
C.  Increasing daily insulin dose
D.  Reducing daily insulin dose

###Answer:","C. Increasing daily insulin dose.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness, along with high morning blood glucose levels, suggest that his insulin dose may not be sufficient to meet his body's needs during the night. Therefore, increasing his daily insulin dose is the optimal intervention to help manage his diabetes and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. Reassurance, adding pramlintide, or reducing his insulin dose would not be appropriate interventions for this patient's condition.",C,False

B.  Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
C.  Tetralogy of Fallot
D.  Mitral valve prolapse

###Answer:","C. Tetralogy of Fallot

Explanation:
The woman has mitral stenosis, which is a narrowing of the mitral valve. The risk of cardiac complications for her infant is not directly related to her mitral stenosis, but rather to her congenital heart disease, which is Tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that can lead to cyanosis (blue baby syndrome) and right-to-left shunting of blood, which can increase the risk of congenital heart disease in the infant. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Tetralogy of Fallot.",C,False

###Options:
A.  Cooling the dialysate
B.  Eating heavier meals during dialysis
C.  Increasing ultrafiltration
D.  Steroid administration

###Answer:","B. Eating heavier meals during dialysis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of lightheadedness and low blood pressure after hemodialysis suggest hypotension, which can increase the risk of falls. Eating heavier meals during dialysis can help maintain blood pressure by providing more fluid and nutrients for the body to absorb. Cooling the dialysate, increasing ultrafiltration, and steroid administration are not appropriate interventions for this scenario.",B,False

B.  Posterior urethral valves
C.  Rocker bottom feet
D.  Duodenal atresia

###Answer:","C. Rocker bottom feet.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question, including low-set ears, retrognathia, and abnormal extremity development, are consistent with features of a syndrome known as ""Potter's syndrome."" This syndrome is caused by oligohydramnios, or a lack of amniotic fluid during pregnancy. Oligohydramnios can result from various causes, including renal agenesis or obstruction, and can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia, which is a condition characterized by underdeveloped lungs. Rocker bottom feet, or talipes equinovarus, is a common feature of Potter's syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,False

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with drug-induced hepatotoxicity, specifically from intravenous heroin use. The rash, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting are common findings in this condition. The normal leukocyte and platelet counts, as well as the normal urinalysis, help to rule out other causes of hepatitis, such as viral or bacterial infections. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and creatinine levels further support the diagnosis. The patient's age, lack of shortness of breath, and normal urinalysis also make other causes of hepatitis less likely. The absence of a family history of serious illness and the lack of a recent hiking trip or exposure to a patient with meningococcemia also make these options less likely.",B,False

D.  Succinyl-CoA + Pi + GDP <=> Succinate + GTP + CoA

###Answer:","C

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the question are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine plays a crucial role in the metabolism of carbohydrates and the synthesis of acetylcholine. The deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms such as confusion, memory loss, and oculomotor abnormalities (nystagmus).

The metabolic pathway that is affected by thiamine deficiency is the Krebs cycle, specifically the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the presence of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as a cofactor. Therefore, the correct answer is C, which is the reaction that converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the Krebs cycle.",C,False

B.  Disregard patient’s request and treat until delivery is complete
C.  Treat and transfer the patient after she makes a written request
D.  Transfer the patient only if the medical benefits of transfer outweigh the risks

###Answer:","D. Transfer the patient only if the medical benefits of transfer outweigh the risks.

Explanation:
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment to anyone who comes to the emergency department, regardless of their ability to pay or insurance status. However, the law also allows for the transfer of patients to another hospital if the medical benefits of transfer outweigh the risks. In this case, the patient is in active labor, has lost a significant amount of blood, and is requesting transfer to a more capable center. The hospital should consider the medical benefits of transfer, such as access to specialized care and potential improvement in maternal and fetal outcomes, and weigh them against the risks of transfer, such as the potential for complications during transport and the possibility of delaying delivery. Ultimately, the decision to transfer should be based on a careful assessment of the individual circumstances and the best interests of the patient and fetus. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to transfer the patient only if the medical benefits of transfer outweigh the risks.",D,False

D.  DNA gyrase inhibitor

###Answer:","C.  Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with sepsis, which is often caused by gram-positive bacteria. The body's response to these bacteria involves the release of inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. Prophylactic antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent sepsis in patients who are at high risk, such as those who have undergone surgery. The most common antibiotics used to treat gram-positive infections are beta-lactams, which work by inhibiting the formation of bacterial cell walls. Therefore, the drug most likely prescribed in this case is a cell wall cross-linking inhibitor.",C,True

###Answer:","C. Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland.

Explanation: The patient's webbed neck suggests the possibility of Turner Syndrome, which is associated with a higher risk of hypertension due to coarctation of the aorta or renal artery stenosis (A). However, the patient's normal weight and short stature are not typical features of Turner Syndrome. The patient's history of amenorrhea and infertility, along with the finding of a webbed neck, suggest the possibility of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), which can cause hypertension due to aldosterone excess from an adrenal tumor (C).

###Options:
A.  Membranous glomerulonephritis
B.  Proximal renal tubular acidosis
C.  Impaired urine diluting ability
D.  Impaired urine concentration ability

###Answer:","C. Impaired urine diluting ability.

Explanation: Sickle cell disease can lead to various renal complications, including chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy, papillary necrosis, and impaired urine diluting ability. The impaired urine diluting ability is due to the sickling of red blood cells in the renal medulla, leading to ischemia and tubular damage. This can result in concentrating defects and an increased risk of dehydration and renal failure. Membranous glomerulonephritis and proximal renal tubular acidosis are not directly related to sickle cell disease.",C,False

D.  540 mg
""

###Answer:","C. 240 mg.

The calculation for the required dosage to maintain a steady state can be done using the following formula:

Required Dose = (Cl x Dose Interval x F)/Fo

Where:
Cl = Plasma clearance (15.0 L/h)
Dose Interval = Time between doses (12 hours)
F = Fraction of the dose that reaches the systemic circulation (oral bioavailability, 75%)
Fo = Fraction of the drug that is bound to plasma proteins (assumed to be 50% for amoxicillin)

Required Dose = (15.0 L/h x 12 hours x 0.75)/(0.5)
Required Dose = 241.4 mg

Therefore, the patient should receive a dosage of 240 mg at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state.",C,False

###Answer:","D. Modafinil.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of insomnia with excessive daytime sleepiness, which is best treated with a wakefulness-promoting agent such as modafinil. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are benzodiazepines, which can help with sleep initiation and maintenance but can also cause daytime sedation and impair cognitive function. Triazolam is a benzodiazepine receptor agonist specifically indicated for short-term treatment of insomnia, but it can also cause next-day sedation and impair cognitive function. Modafinil, on the other hand, is a wakefulness-promoting agent that can improve daytime alertness and cognitive function without causing significant sedation or impairing nighttime sleep.",D,False

###Options:
A.  Tricuspid valve stenosis
B.  Mitral valve prolapse
C.  Mitral valve stenosis
D.  Aortic valve stenosis

###Answer:","D. Aortic valve stenosis.

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue with minimal exertion, along with weak peripheral pulses, are consistent with a diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis. This condition is characterized by a narrowing of the aortic valve opening, which can lead to decreased blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. This can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness with exertion. The physical examination finding of weak peripheral pulses is also consistent with aortic valve stenosis, as the narrowed valve can lead to increased pressure in the left ventricle, which can decrease the amount of blood that is able to flow out of the heart and into the peripheral circulation.

Tricuspid valve stenosis and mitral valve prolapse are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Tricuspid valve stenosis is characterized by a narrowing of the tricuspid valve, which can lead to symptoms such as jugular vein distension, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema. Mitral valve stenosis is characterized by a narrowing of the mitral valve, which can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, and a heart murmur.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided is aortic valve stenosis.",D,True

###Options:

B.  Increased phosphorylation of myosin
C.  Increased production of nitric oxide
D.  Decreased concentration of bradykinin

###Answer:","D. Decreased concentration of bradykinin.

Explanation: Arginine is a precursor for nitric oxide synthesis. Decreased arginine levels suggest decreased nitric oxide production, which can lead to endothelial dysfunction. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator that acts synergistically with nitric oxide to maintain vascular tone. Decreased bradykinin levels can exacerbate the endothelial dysfunction caused by decreased nitric oxide production. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the finding of decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells is decreased concentration of bradykinin.",D,False

###Options:
A.  Renal agenesis
B.  Pulmonary hypoplasia
C.  Duodenal atresia
D.  Posterior urethral valve

###Answer:","B. Pulmonary hypoplasia.

Explanation:
The given clinical scenario suggests the presence of polyhydramnios, which is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid. Polyhydramnios can be caused by various fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions, including pulmonary hypoplasia. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a condition where the lungs do not develop properly due to decreased intrauterine space or other factors. This can result in an increased production of amniotic fluid as the fetus swallows more to meet its fluid needs. Other possible causes of polyhydramnios include neural tube defects, gastrointestinal tract anomalies, and chromosomal abnormalities. However, in this case, the other options listed do not typically cause polyhydramnios. Renal agenesis and posterior urethral valve can cause oligohydramnios, which is a decrease in amniotic fluid. Duodenal atresia can cause polyhydramnios, but it is usually associated with other abnormalities such as trisomy 21, and the ultrasound findings in this case do not suggest any other abnormalities. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. Pulmonary hypoplasia.",B,False

###Answer:","B. WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low.

This presentation is most consistent with septic arthritis, which is characterized by sudden onset of severe pain, joint redness, warmth, and swelling. The laboratory findings of increased CRP and procalcitonin levels further support this diagnosis. The synovial fluid in septic arthritis typically shows a high white blood cell count (>50,000 cells/mm3) with a predominance of neutrophils (>75%). The viscosity is often low due to the inflammatory process. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,True

The patient is admitted to the hospital for close observation and placed on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as part of a routine protocol. Laboratory findings drawn sometime after admission demonstrate a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Which of the following factors is most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis?
###Options:
A.  VII
B.  VIIa
C.  X
D.  XII

###Answer:","C. X

Explanation:
The DVT prophylaxis is typically administered to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It does not directly affect the coagulation factors VII, VIIa, X, or XII. However, the laboratory findings of a normal PT and elevated PTT suggest the presence of an inhibitor, such as heparin or a lupus anticoagulant, which may affect the activity of factor X. Therefore, the DVT prophylaxis is most likely affecting the activity of factor X indirectly by increasing the risk of bleeding due to the anticoagulant effect of the medication.",C,True

###Answer:","B. Lumbar puncture.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe headache, transient vision loss, blurry vision, and tinnitus, along with the normal head CT, suggest the possibility of an intracranial mass or inflammatory process. A lumbar puncture would be the best next step to evaluate for infectious or inflammatory causes, such as meningitis or encephalitis.

###Options:
A.  Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release
B.  Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation
C.  Nondisjunction of chromosomes
D.  Nutritional imbalance

###Answer:","A. Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release.

Explanation: The patient's amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and temporal field visual defects are consistent with Sheehan syndrome, which is caused by necrosis of the pituitary gland following severe blood loss during childbirth or other causes. This results in the inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, leading to amenorrhea and galactorrhea. The patient's history of forearm fractures and increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision suggest a possible car accident, which could have resulted in significant blood loss and pituitary necrosis. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A,True

###Question: A 54-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He reports that he recently went on a vacation to South America with his family but just wanted to stay in his hotel all day due to fatigue.

A bone marrow aspiration is ordered but after multiple attempts, they are unable to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample. A peripheral blood smear would likely reveal cells that stain with which of the following stains?
###Options:
A.  Prussian Blue
B.  Ziehl-Neelsen
C.  Periodic acid-Schiff
D.  Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase

###Answer:","D. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a possibility of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or other myeloproliferative neoplasms. These disorders are characterized by splenomegaly and peripheral blood smear findings of leukocytosis with an increased number of mature granulocytes and basophils. The bone marrow aspiration failure and the need for further evaluation suggest a diagnosis other than anemia or infection. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is an enzyme that is often elevated in myeloid leukemias, including CML. Therefore, a peripheral blood smear stained with TRAP would be the most likely option to reveal relevant cells in this case.",D,True

###Options:

D.  Chief cell destruction

###Answer:","B. Enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, lethargy, and epigastric pain after eating, along with pale conjunctivae and decreased hemoglobin levels, suggest anemia. The increased serum gastrin levels and inflammation of the gastric body and fundus are consistent with atrophic gastritis. The photomicrograph shows intestinal metaplasia, which is a common finding in atrophic gastritis. Enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells) are increased in number in response to chronic atrophic gastritis, leading to the production of excessive amounts of gastrin. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia.",B,False

###Question: A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not yet had her period. She is at the 10th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Examination shows a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled 20° away from the body when fully extended, and shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally.

A.  Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure
B.  Administration of gonadotropins will increase the chances of conceiving
C.  Impaired tubal ciliary function will prevent natural fertilization
D.  The majority of patients become pregnant without medical assistance

###Answer:","C. Impaired tubal ciliary function will prevent natural fertilization.

Explanation: The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with Turner Syndrome, which is characterized by short stature, broad chest, widely spaced nipples, low posterior hairline, shortened fourth metacarpals, and primary amenorrhea. Turner Syndrome is caused by the absence of one X chromosome, leading to gonadal dysgenesis and primary ovarian failure. The patient's sexual development is at Tanner stage 1, indicating the absence of secondary sexual characteristics. The patient's fertility is significantly impaired due to the absence of functional ovaries and the associated lack of oocytes. The patient may require assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor oocytes, to achieve pregnancy. The patient's tubal ciliary function is also impaired due to the absence of functional ovaries, which can prevent natural fertilization. Therefore, option C is the most accurate statement about this patient's fertility.",C,False

D.  EEG

###Answer:","C. X-ray of the arm and shoulder.

Explanation: The first priority in evaluating a patient who has been struck by a high-voltage power line is to assess for injuries related to the electrical contact, as well as potential complications from the electrical injury itself. An X-ray of the arm and shoulder is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test to evaluate for fractures or other injuries that may have occurred as a result of the fall or contact with the power line. Once any injuries related to the electrical contact have been identified and addressed, further diagnostic tests such as a FAST ultrasound assessment or urinalysis may be indicated to evaluate for other potential injuries or complications. An EEG would not be the first diagnostic test to consider in this scenario.",C,False

###Answer:","D. Gamma-hemolytic cocci in chains.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with a postpartum infection, specifically a postpartum endometritis. The most common causative organisms of postpartum endometritis are group A streptococci and E. coli. Group A streptococci are beta-hemolytic cocci, while E. coli are non-hemolytic gram-negative rods. However, postpartum endometritis caused by group A streptococci can sometimes present with a gamma-hemolytic pattern on blood cultures due to the production of a large amount of streptokinase. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's disorder is gamma-hemolytic cocci in chains.",D,False

###Options:
A.  45/195
B.  30/400
C.  (30/200) / (30/400)
D.  30/200

###Answer:","A. 45/195

Explanation:

The number of people with GERD in the alcoholic group is 30, and the number of people without GERD in the alcoholic group is 170 (200 - 30). The number of people with GERD in the non-alcoholic group is 30, and the number of people without GERD in the non-alcoholic group is 370 (400 - 30).

The fraction of people with GERD in the alcoholic group is 30/200 = 0.15, and the fraction of people with GERD in the non-alcoholic group is 30/400 = 0.075.

The total number of people with GERD in the town is 30 + 30 = 60. The number of people without GERD in the town is 10,000 - 60 = 9,940.

The fraction of people with GERD in the town is 60/10,000 = 0.006.

The number of people who would have GERD if everyone in the town consumed alcohol is 10,000 * 0.006 = 60.

The number of people who would not have GERD if everyone in the town stopped consuming alcohol is 9,940.

The fraction of GERD that can be prevented by stopping alcohol consumption in the town is (9,940 - 60) / 9,940 = 45/45 + (9,880 - 60) / 9,940 = 1 + 9,820/9,940 = 1 + 0.989 = 1.989 ≈ 2 - 0.011 = 1.999 ≈ 2 - 0.02 = 1.98 ≈ 1.9796 ≈ 1.9796 * (30/200) / (30",A,True

D.  No further testing is necessary

###Answer:","A.  Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening.

Explanation:
The patient is sexually active and has a history of cancer in first-degree relatives. Therefore, she is at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, and chlamydia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends annual screening for sexually active women younger than 25 years and those with risk factors for STIs. The patient's age, sexual activity, and family history meet these criteria. Therefore, the best recommendation is to perform screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.",A,True

At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient’s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder?
###Options:
A.  Autosomal dominant
B.  Autosomal recessive
C.  Noninherited somatic mutation
D.  X-linked dominant

###Answer:","B. Autosomal recessive.

Trinucleotide repeat disorders are typically autosomal recessive, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Examples of trinucleotide repeat disorders include Huntington's disease and Fragile X syndrome. The long and narrow face appearance described in the question is a common feature of some trinucleotide repeat disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome.",B,False

D.  Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors

###Answer:","D. Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors.

The patient's symptoms of frequent heartburn and chest pain following food ingestion, which are alleviated by antacids, suggest that his GERD is not well controlled. Cimetidine, which the patient was previously taking, is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist used to treat GERD by reducing gastric acid secretion. The new medication prescribed for him is likely to be another H2 receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which also reduces gastric acid secretion. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the new medication is reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors.",D,False

###Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for evaluation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes. He has no history of major medical illness. He had a sore throat and cough 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical examination shows moderate periorbital edema and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. A kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Which of the following is most likely to be found on urinalysis?
###Options:
A.  Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins
B.  Fatty casts and albumin
C.  White blood cell casts and eosinophils
D.  Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells

###Answer:","B. Fatty casts and albumin.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the question are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The kidney biopsy findings of podocyte effacement on electron microscopy are consistent with minimal change disease, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Fatty casts are a common finding in the urine of patients with nephrotic syndrome due to the high proteinuria. Albuminuria is also a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,True
8550cae6-ae92-4e53-925f-f376c25aa0a2,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.

D.  Selection bias

###Answer:","C. Lead-time bias.

Explanation: The earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound does not cause the difference in outcomes, but rather leads to an artificially longer survival time. This is an example of lead-time bias, which occurs when an earlier diagnosis or intervention artificially extends the time between the onset of a disease and its clinical recognition, but does not actually affect the underlying disease progression or mortality.",C,False

Explanation: The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the possibility of a cardiac myxoma, which is a common type of primary cardiac tumor. Myxomas are typically benign and composed of mucoid material and spindle-shaped cells, which are characteristic of mesenchymal tissue. However, they can also contain atypical melanocytes, which can be seen in up to 10% of cases. Therefore, the biopsy is likely to show nests of atypical melanocytes.

""

###Answer:","D. Factitious disorder imposed on another.

The symptoms described, including the repeated episodes of decreased consciousness, normalization of symptoms after treatment, and abnormal lab results (low glucose and high insulin with low C-peptide), are consistent with factitious disorder imposed on another (also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy). In this condition, a caregiver (in this case, the mother) intentionally causes or fabricates symptoms in a person under their care. The low C-peptide level suggests exogenous insulin administration. Malingering and conversion disorder are not consistent with the presented information. Primary adrenal insufficiency would not present with such low glucose levels and normalization after dextrose infusion.",D,True

###Answer:","A. Sorbitol dehydrogenase.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the question, including blurry vision and narrowing of retinal arteries with microaneurysms, are consistent with diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that damages the blood vessels in the retina. The primary metabolic change in diabetic retinopathy is the accumulation of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, due to the overexpression of the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. This leads to the development of diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,True

###Options:
A.  Decreased lymphocyte count
B.  Increased platelet count
C.  Increased prothrombin time
D.  Decreased gamma globulin

###Answer:","D. Decreased gamma globulin.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against desmoglein proteins in the skin and mucous membranes. These autoantibodies cause the disruption of intercellular adhesion, leading to the formation of blisters and erosions. The disease is associated with a decrease in gamma globulin levels due to the consumption of immunoglobulins in the production of antibodies. Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation of this patient would be a decreased gamma globulin level.",D,False

Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings?
###Options:
A.  Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques
B.  Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution
C.  Photophobia and phonophobia
D.  Rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis

###Answer:","A. Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques.

This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of the face, known as the trigeminal distribution, is a common finding in multiple sclerosis. The intermittent stabbing face pain, known as trigeminal neuralgia, can also be a symptom of multiple sclerosis. The weakness in the left upper extremity and spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus are also consistent with multiple sclerosis. Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques are a common finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with multiple sclerosis. Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques.",A,True

This patient's symptoms and exam findings are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), likely caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The recent use of ciprofloxacin for a UTI may have contributed to the development of this infection due to the potential for antibiotic resistance. Given the severity of her symptoms, including fever, right lower quadrant tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass, she should be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotics, such as cefotetan and doxycycline, to ensure adequate coverage for common STIs causing PID, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Additionally, her symptoms may indicate the presence of a tubo-ovarian abscess, which requires close monitoring and potential surgical intervention.

Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Cefepime
B.  Cefotaxime
C.  Amoxicillin
D.  Cephalexin

###Answer:","B. Cefotaxime. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with an acute suppurative labyrinthitis, likely caused by a bacterial infection. The most common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefotaxime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that covers these organisms effectively. Cefepime and cephalexin have less coverage against the causative organisms, and amoxicillin may not be effective due to the beta-lactamase production by some strains of Haemophilus influenzae.",B,False

###Answer:","B. Inhibitor of microtubule polymerization.

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with gout, which is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joint. The most common medication used to prevent recurrent gout attacks is colchicine, which is a microtubule inhibitor. This drug works by inhibiting the formation of microtubules, which are necessary for the intracellular transport of MSU crystals to the site of inflammation. The side effect of pancytopenia is a known complication of colchicine therapy.",B,False

Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)
B.  Oxytocin-induced labor
C.  Manual uterine aspiration
D.  Oral mifepristone + misoprostol

###Answer:","D. Oral mifepristone + misoprostol.

Explanation:
The patient is a G2P2L2 (Gravida 2, Para 2, Living 2) woman, which means she has had two previous pregnancies, both resulting in live births. She is currently 4 weeks late for her menstrual cycle and has a positive pregnancy test. She desires to terminate the pregnancy and inquires about the possibility of an elective abortion.

The most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient would be medical abortion using oral mifepristone and misoprostol. This method is recommended for women up to 10 weeks of gestation and is more convenient, less invasive, and has fewer complications compared to D&E, which is a surgical procedure. Oxytocin-induced labor and manual uterine aspiration are not appropriate methods for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient.",D,True

D.  Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume

###Answer:","C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterized by airflow limitation and hyperinflation of the lungs. The increased chest diameter and hyperresonance to percussion are signs of hyperinflation. The decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is a result of the airflow limitation. The increased residual volume is a result of the inability to fully exhale all the air from the lungs, leading to trapping of air in the lungs.",C,True

###Options:
A.  Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy
B.  Dietary restriction of phenylalanine
C.  Daily allopurinol intake
D.  Avoidance of fasting states

###Answer:","D. Avoidance of fasting states.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU), which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological problems if left untreated. The musty odor and poor eye contact are also common findings in PKU. The disorder can be prevented by a dietary restriction of phenylalanine, which should be started as soon as possible after birth. The other options are not related to PKU.",D,False

###Question: A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?
###Options:
A.  Confidence interval should have been 90%.
B.  A type 2 error is not possible in this case.
C.  A type 2 error has been made.
D.  A type 1 error has been made.

###Answer:","C. A type 2 error has been made.

Explanation:
The researcher has rejected the null hypothesis with a p-value of 0.049, which is below the commonly used significance level of 0.05. However, the hypothesis test was conducted to disprove the null hypothesis, which means that the researcher was looking for evidence against the null hypothesis. This approach increases the likelihood of making a type 2 error, which is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. In this case, the researcher has concluded that low birth weight is associated with obesity, but the study may not have had enough power to detect a weak or small association. Therefore, the correct answer is C. A type 2 error has been made.",C,False

D.  Opioid overdose

###Answer:","D. Opioid overdose. The patient's presentation is consistent with opioid toxicity, which can cause respiratory depression, decreased level of consciousness, and pinpoint pupils. The metabolic acidosis seen in this patient is a result of hypoventilation, leading to an increase in CO2 production and a decrease in pH. Diabetic ketoacidosis would present with a higher anion gap, and diuretic overdose would not typically present with this degree of respiratory depression or altered level of consciousness. Hyperventilation would result in a decrease in CO2 levels and an increase in pH.",D,True

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSABs) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. TSABs cause hyperthyroidism by stimulating the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms such as heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and edema. The waxy discoloration in the legs is a sign of pretibial myxedema, a complication of Graves' disease. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies.",B,False

###Options:
A.  Anatomical dead space
B.  Lung compliance
C.  Radial traction on airway wall
D.  Small airway wall thickness

###Answer:","C. Radial traction on airway wall.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically emphysema. Emphysema is characterized by destruction of the alveolar walls, leading to increased radial traction on the airway walls and decreased elastic recoil of the lungs. This results in increased expiratory flow rates, as the patient is able to exhale more air due to the decreased resistance caused by the destroyed alveolar walls. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,True

###Options:
A.  Decreased prostaglandin synthesis
B.  Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole
C.  Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum
D.  Decreased gastric blood flow

###Answer:","D. Decreased gastric blood flow.

Explanation: The patient's tarry black stools and hypotension suggest significant gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from the stomach or upper intestine. Decreased gastric blood flow, as might occur in severe shock or hypovolemia, can lead to mucosal ischemia and ulceration, resulting in gastrointestinal bleeding. The other options are less likely causes in this scenario. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis, while a cause of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding, is not typically associated with tarry stools. Erosion of tortuous submucosal arterioles, such as in angiodysplasia, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding but is not typically associated with tarry stools. Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum, while a cause of tarry stools through the production of melanin-containing pigments, is not typically associated with hypotension and tachycardia.",D,True

###Question: A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?
###Options:

###Question: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?
###Options:
A.  3,000 units
B.  1,500 units
C.  6,000 units
D.  Cannot be calculated, as bioavailability is not known

###Answer:","C. 6,000 units

Explanation:
The formula for calculating the loading dose of heparin is:
Loading dose = Desired plasma concentration × Volume of distribution
Volume of distribution of heparin is given as 60 mL/kg.
Weight of the patient is 50 kg.
Desired plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL.

So,
Loading dose = 0.5 units/mL × 60 mL/kg × 50 kg
Loading dose = 15,000 units

However, since the patient's actual weight is less than the ideal body weight of 60 kg (used to calculate the volume of distribution), a weight-adjusted dose should be used. The ideal body weight is typically used for dosing calculations, and a weight adjustment factor is applied for underweight patients.

For underweight patients, the weight adjustment factor is 0.85.

So,
Loading dose = 15,000 units × 0.85
Loading dose = 12,750 units

The closest option to this calculated loading dose is C. 6,000 units. However, this is an underdose, and a higher dose may be required. Therefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient would be between 6,000 and 12,750 units, depending on the clinical response.",C,False

B.  RNase
C.  Superoxide dismutase
D.  Telomerase

###Answer:","D. Telomerase.

Explanation: Liposarcomas are a type of soft tissue sarcoma characterized by the presence of malignant adipocytes (fat cells). They are typically characterized by the presence of atypical, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic cells, as well as increased cellularity and the presence of necrosis. Telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length, is often overexpressed in various types of cancer, including liposarcomas. This overexpression is thought to contribute to the unlimited cellular proliferation that is characteristic of malignant tumors. Therefore, the answer is D. Telomerase.",D,True

The right humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process. Sensation to pinprick over which of the following skin areas is most likely to be reduced?
###Options:
A.  Medial aspect of the upper arm
B.  Lateral aspect of the shoulder
C.  Skin above the clavicle
D.  Dorsal aspect of forearm and hand

###Answer:","B. Lateral aspect of the shoulder.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with a dislocated shoulder, specifically a posterior dislocation. In this type of dislocation, the humeral head is displaced posteriorly and inferiorly, leading to the loss of the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder and the sensation of the humeral head being palpable below the coracoid process. The lateral aspect of the shoulder is the area most likely to be affected by reduced sensation due to the disruption of the nerves that supply this area during the dislocation.",B,True

###Options:
A.  Decreased production of PGE2
B.  Buildup of a toxic metabolite due to kidney disease
C.  Increased stimulation of the vagus nerve
D.  Hypovolemia

###Answer:","D. Hypovolemia. The symptoms described, including severe abdominal pain, evidence of crepitus, and a gastric perforation on CT scan, are consistent with a perforated ulcer, which is commonly caused by long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or stress-induced erosion of the gastric mucosa. However, the patient's history of a suicide attempt and the presence of an empty pill bottle suggest that she may have taken an overdose of a medication, such as an opioid or an antidepressant, which can also cause gastric perforation. Hypovolemia, or decreased blood volume, can occur as a result of vomiting or bleeding, which can lead to decreased gastric mucosal blood flow and increased gastric acid production, making the gastric mucosa more susceptible to ulceration and perforation. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's gastric perforation is hypovolemia.",D,False

###Options:
A.  Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine
B.  Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines
C.  Antagonizing the NMDA receptor
D.  Inhibiting the GABA receptor

###Answer:","C. Antagonizing the NMDA receptor.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, dilated pupils, and perforated nasal septum, are consistent with sympathomimetic toxicity, likely due to the use of cocaine or another sympathomimetic drug. NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine and phencyclidine, can also cause sympathomimetic symptoms, but they are not typically associated with dilated pupils or perforated nasal septums. However, these symptoms can occur in cases of severe NMDA receptor antagonist toxicity. Therefore, while the most likely explanation is sympathomimetic toxicity, it is important to consider the possibility of NMDA receptor antagonist toxicity in this patient, especially given his history of homelessness and drug use.

Therefore, the answer is C. Antagonizing the NMDA receptor.",C,False

###Answer:","B.  15%

Explanation:

To find the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, we can use the z-score formula:

z = (X - μ) / σ

where X is the hemoglobin concentration we're interested in, μ is the mean hemoglobin concentration, and σ is the standard error.

First, we need to find the z-score:

z = (18 - 17) / 0.1
z = 1

Next, we can use a standard normal distribution table or calculator to find the probability associated with a z-score of 1. The probability is approximately 15.87%, or we can round to 15% for simplicity.

Therefore, the answer is B.",B,True

###Answer:","B. Cutaneous xanthomas.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with chronic hepatitis B infection. Cutaneous xanthomas are a common finding in patients with hyperlipidemia, but they can also occur in patients with liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B infection. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer. Inferior vena cava thrombosis, increased CA 19-9 levels, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are not associated with chronic hepatitis B infection.",B,True

###Options:
A.  150 milligrams
B.  430 milligrams
C.  1200 milligrams
D.  3600 milligrams

###Answer:","D. 3600 milligrams

Explanation:
To calculate the maintenance dose, we need to determine the clearance of the drug and then calculate the dose based on the desired plasma concentration and the drug's half-life.

First, we need to calculate the clearance:

Clearance = Dose / Plasma concentration

We want to find the dose required to maintain a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L. We know the plasma concentration, the drug's half-life, and its volume of distribution.

We can use the following formula to calculate the clearance:

Clearance = (Dose / Plasma concentration) = (Dose / 15 mg/L)

We also know that the bioavailability of the drug is 50%, so we need to adjust the dose for that as well.

Clearance = (Dose / Plasma concentration) = (Dose / 15 mg/L) = (2 * Dose / 30 mg/L)

Now we can set up an equation to solve for the dose:

Clearance = (2 * Dose / 30 mg/L) = (14.3 L / 2 hours)

Solving for Dose:

Dose = (Clearance * 2 hours) / 2
Dose = (14.3 L / 2 hours) * 2 / 2
Dose = 14.3 L / hour

Now we need to find the dose required to maintain a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L every 8 hours. We can use the following formula:

Maintenance dose = Clearance * Desired plasma concentration / Half-life

Plugging in the values:

Maintenance dose = 14.3 L/hour * 15 mg/L / 2 hours
Maintenance dose = 14.3 * 15 / 2
Maintenance dose = 3600 milligrams

Therefore, the answer is D. 3600 milligrams.",D,False

###Options:
A.  Human immunodeficiency virus infection
B.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
C.  Adrenocortical insufficiency
D.  Pheochromocytoma

###Answer:","C. Adrenocortical insufficiency. The patient's symptoms, including low blood pressure, fever, and neck rigidity, are consistent with meningitis or meningeal inflammation. Adrenocortical insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, can present with symptoms similar to meningitis, including low blood pressure, fever, and neck rigidity. It is a rare cause of low blood pressure, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in the context of a patient with a history of a ""running nose"" and no significant past medical history. The other options, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and pheochromocytoma, are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms and low blood pressure.",C,True

###Options:
A.  Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione
B.  Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen
C.  Deficiency of ATP
D.  Osmotically fragile erythrocytes

###Answer:","D. Osmotically fragile erythrocytes.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), specifically Rh incompatibility. Rh HDN is caused by maternal antibodies against the Rh antigen on the fetal red blood cells. These antibodies cross the placenta and cause hemolysis (destruction) of the fetal red blood cells. The resulting hemolysis leads to the release of hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can cause jaundice, anemia, and other symptoms. Osmotically fragile erythrocytes are a result of the hemolysis and the release of hemoglobin into the plasma, making the red blood cells more susceptible to rupture when exposed to hypertonic solutions. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,False

C.  No effect on afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole
D.  No effect on afferent arteriole and dilation of efferent arteriole

###Answer:","C. No effect on afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole.

Explanation: Over the counter medications such as acetaminophen, which was given to the 13-year-old boy, can cause hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity can lead to renal vasoconstriction, which results in a decrease in renal blood flow and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. This is due to the constriction of the efferent arteriole, which reduces the blood flow back to the peritubular capillaries, leading to a decrease in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the nephron. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,False

###Question: A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with dysphagia and halitosis. If this patient is also found to have cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, which of the following is the most likely cause of his presenting symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease
B.  Esophageal candidiasis
C.  Meckel's diverticulum
D.  Zenker's diverticulum

###Answer:","D. Zenker's diverticulum.

Cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction is a common finding in patients with Zenker's diverticulum, which is a pouch formation in the posterior wall of the pharynx, above the circopharyngeus muscle. This condition can cause dysphagia and halitosis due to the pooling of food and saliva in the diverticulum. Gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal candidiasis can also cause dysphagia and halitosis, but they are not directly related to cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction. Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital condition located in the ileum, and it is not associated with dysphagia or halitosis.",D,True

###Answer:","C. Botulism antitoxin. The symptoms described in the question are consistent with botulism, which is caused by a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Botulism can cause flaccid paralysis, which is present in this case, as well as cranial nerve palsies, which are not mentioned in the question but are common in botulism. The persistent cough and the absence of knee and ankle jerk reflexes are also consistent with botulism. The laboratory findings, including the low leukocyte count, high eosinophil count, and normal creatine kinase level, are not specific for botulism but are consistent with a viral infection, which the patient had three weeks prior. However, the high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the low cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentration are consistent with botulism. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of botulism antitoxin.",C,False

D.  Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH

###Answer:","A. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.

Explanation:
The dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by hypercortisolism. In this test, the patient is given a low dose of dexamethasone, and if the cortisol levels do not suppress, it suggests an endogenous source of cortisol production, such as a pituitary adenoma. In the case of a pituitary adenoma, the ACTH levels would be increased with the low dose of dexamethasone, but decreased with the high dose due to feedback inhibition. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,False

B.  Boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray
C.  Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible
D.  Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible

###Answer:","C

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the question are consistent with cyanosis due to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). This condition is characterized by difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and a high pulse rate. The crying improves the symptoms due to increased work of breathing and subsequent increase in oxygen saturation. The passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth may be difficult due to the increased tone of the muscles of the upper airway and the possibility of meconium aspiration. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,False

D.  Decreased K+ efflux during phase 3
""

###Answer:","D. Decreased K+ efflux during phase 3.

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with an allergic reaction, specifically anaphylaxis. Common medications used to treat anaphylaxis include epinephrine and diphenhydramine. Both of these medications can decrease the K+ efflux during phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, leading to prolonged depolarization and increased automaticity of the pacemaker cells. This can help to increase heart rate and improve cardiac output in the setting of hypotension and shock.",D,False

###Answer:","C.  47XYY

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the question are consistent with a molar pregnancy, which is a complication of pregnancy characterized by the abnormal growth of the placenta. Molar pregnancies are typically chromosomally abnormal and are classified as either hydatidiform moles or invasive moles. Hydatidiform moles are further classified as complete or partial based on the presence or absence of fetal tissue. In a complete hydatidiform mole, there is no fetal tissue present, and the entire placenta is composed of trophoblast cells. The chromosomal makeup of a complete hydatidiform mole is 46,XX or 46,XY, but since the woman in this case is 32 years old and has not had a menstrual period for 4 months, it is more likely that this is a molar pregnancy with a chromosomal makeup of 47,XXY or 47,XYY.

###Options:
A.  Increased lung compliance
B.  Decreased residual volume
C.  Increased chest wall compliance
D.  Decreased A-a gradient

###Answer:","B. Decreased residual volume.

Explanation:
The given patient is a 76-year-old woman with well-controlled hypertension, no history of smoking or illicit drug use, and a daily walking routine. She has a normal pulse, respirations, and blood pressure. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

Compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, the most likely change in respiratory function in this patient is a decrease in residual volume. This is due to the aging process, which results in a decrease in lung volume and an increase in the proportion of residual volume to total lung capacity. This leads to a decrease in the amount of air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation.

Therefore, the answer is B. Decreased residual volume.",B,False

A photomicrograph from a biopsy of the nodule is shown. Serum studies in this patient are most likely to show increased levels of which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Rheumatoid factor
B.  Angiotensin converting enzyme
C.  Low-density lipoprotein
D.  Triglycerides

###Answer:","D. Triglycerides.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a calcaneal bursitis or a plantar fibroma, which are not related to rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular disease. However, the patient's mother had a myocardial infarction, which may suggest a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease. The biopsy result is not provided, but it is unlikely to be relevant to the serum studies. Therefore, the most likely answer is D, increased triglycerides, which may be seen in conditions associated with obesity or insulin resistance.",D,False

###Answer:","C. Spermicidal foam

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Spermicidal foam can irritate the genital area and increase the risk of developing HPV-related lesions. Using condoms inconsistently does not prevent HPV transmission, as HPV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact in areas not covered by the condom. Anti-HIV prophylaxis does not prevent HPV infection. Vaccination against HPV is an effective preventative measure, but it would not have helped this patient as she has already been infected.",C,False

A.  Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining
B.  Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue
C.  Ground-glass hepatocytes
D.  Positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue

###Answer:","B. Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and vital signs suggest congestive heart failure, and the presence of a systolic murmur and accentuated pulmonic component of S2 suggest tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's history of myocardial infarctions and chronic heart failure increase the likelihood of left-sided heart failure leading to pulmonary congestion. The development of ventricular fibrillation suggests severe heart failure and impending cardiogenic shock. Prussian-blue staining is used to detect intracellular iron deposits, which can be seen in patients with chronic heart failure due to the increased production of erythropoietin and subsequent increased iron absorption in the renal tubules. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,False

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?""
""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants

B.  Dissection of an intracerebral vessel
C.  Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm
D.  Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles

###Answer:","D. Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a primary headache disorder, specifically a medication-overuse headache (MOH) or a transformed migraine. The headaches are bilateral, band-like, and worsened by physical activity, such as coughing or laughing. The absence of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, as well as the lack of focal neurologic symptoms, further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's history of arterial hypertension and stable angina pectoris, as well as her current medications, increase the likelihood of medication-overuse headaches. The use of isosorbide mononitrate, a nitrate medication, can also contribute to rebound headaches.

The patient's recent upper respiratory infection may have triggered the onset of her headaches, as some viral infections can precipitate migraines or medication-overuse headaches.

The physical examination findings, including the accentuated S2 heart sound and painless paranasal sinus palpation, are not indicative of a subdural hematoma, dissection, or intracranial neoplasm.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is dilation of the intracerebral arterioles.",D,True

###Question: A 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. She wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when she does not apply sunscreen. Current medications include demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Physical examination shows prominent erythema and a papular eruption on her forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Degranulation of presensitized mast cells
B.  Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies
C.  Accumulation of porphobilinogen
D.  Cell injury due to drug metabolites

###Answer:","A. Degranulation of presensitized mast cells.

This patient's symptoms are consistent with a sunburn reaction, specifically a phototoxic reaction. Phototoxic reactions occur when a substance, in this case likely demeclocycline, makes the skin more sensitive to sunlight, leading to mast cell degranulation and the release of histamine and other mediators. This results in the characteristic erythema, papules, and burning sensation seen in the patient. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is option A: Degranulation of presensitized mast cells.",A,False

A.  Required for collagen hydroxylation
B.  Required for dehydrogenase enzymes
C.  Required for methionine processing
D.  Required for methylmalonyl-CoA processing

###Answer:","D. Required for methylmalonyl-CoA processing.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the discovery of acid-fast bacilli in her sputum suggest tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which requires folic acid and vitamin B12 for growth, but also requires thiamine, pyridoxine, and niacin for optimal growth. However, the patient's new symptoms of skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion suggest that she may have developed tuberculosis meningitis, which can lead to deficiencies in thiamine, pyridoxine, and niacin due to impaired absorption or metabolism. Therefore, she was likely given thiamine, pyridoxine, and niacin, but she may also have been given parenteral vitamin K to prevent or treat hemorrhagic complications, which is the characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided. However, since the question asks for a characteristic of the factor, and not the factor itself, the answer is D, which is the characteristic of vitamin K: it is required for methylmalonyl-CoA processing.",D,False

###Answer:","D.

Explanation:
Ovarian cancer typically spreads through the lymphatic system to the para-aortic and iliac lymph nodes. From there, it can spread to the thoracic duct and eventually reach the left subclavian vein, allowing it to metastasize to the brain via the systemic circulation. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,True

Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Chronic bilirubin toxicity
B.  Chronic acetaldehyde influence
C.  Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids
D.  Influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters

###Answer:","C. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of early satiety, abdominal discomfort, and bloating, along with weight loss, pale and dry skin, and decreased muscle strength, suggest malabsorption and malnutrition. The patient's low BMI, microcytic anemia, and low reticulocyte count suggest chronic blood loss, likely from the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's history of hepatitis B and current distended and tender abdomen suggest liver damage, which can lead to malabsorption and malnutrition. The patient's neurological symptoms of symmetrical distal hypoesthesia and decreased muscle strength, along with decreased mental status, suggest a demyelinating neuropathy. The patient's low mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume, along with the presence of atrophic papillae on the tongue, suggest a vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's low methylmalonic acid level, which is a byproduct of vitamin B12 metabolism, further supports this diagnosis. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids, which is a result of a vitamin B12 deficiency, can lead to the neurological and psychiatric symptoms described in the patient. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,True

###Options:
A.  Yeast with pseudohyphae
B.  Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation
C.  Gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule
D.  Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease

###Answer:","D. Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease.

Explanation: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with a case of streptococcal pharyngitis, commonly known as ""strep throat."" The grayish-white pseudomembrane and uneven elevation of the soft palate are characteristic findings on examination of the oropharynx in this condition. The marked enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes is also a common finding in strep throat. The organism responsible for strep throat is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobe called Streptococcus pyogenes. This bacterium produces several virulence factors, including IgA protease, which helps it evade the host immune response. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,False

###Question: A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. Which of the following changes to the serum is most likely to develop as an adverse effect of the prescribed drug?
###Options:
A.  Increased creatine kinase concentration
B.  Decreased glucose concentration
C.  Increased triglyceride concentration
D.  Increased bradykinin concentration

###Answer:","C. Increased triglyceride concentration.

The prescribed drug is a statin, which decreases the production of mevalonate, a precursor to cholesterol synthesis. As a result, statins increase the expression of genes involved in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, leading to an increase in HDL cholesterol and a decrease in LDL cholesterol. However, statins also inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are important for the function of several proteins, including those involved in the synthesis of sterols and triglycerides. This can lead to an increase in triglyceride levels.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased triglyceride concentration.",C,False

###Question: After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?
###Options:
A.  Pre-T cell
B.  Double-positive T cell
C.  Single-positive CD4+ T cell
D.  Single-positive CD8+ T cell

###Answer:","C. Single-positive CD4+ T cell

Explanation: Positive selection occurs in the thymus during the maturation of single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, since the question asks for the stage of a T cell that undergoes positive selection, the correct answer is C, Single-positive CD4+ T cell. This is because positive selection occurs after the T cell has undergone rearrangement of its T cell receptor (TCR) genes and has expressed a functional TCR on its surface. Single-positive CD4+ T cells express only the CD4 coreceptor and have undergone positive selection in the thymus, while double-positive T cells still express both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors and have not yet undergone positive selection. Single-positive CD8+ T cells have undergone positive selection in the thymus but express only the CD8 coreceptor. Pre-T cells are immature T cell progenitors that have not yet undergone TCR gene rearrangement.",C,False

###Answer:","C. Is more common in parrot owners

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and travel history are consistent with a diagnosis of travelers' diarrhea caused by enteric pathogens, most commonly Norovirus or Campylobacter. However, the additional information about chest exam, chest radiograph, and lab results suggest that this patient may also have a concurrent respiratory infection. The most likely cause of this respiratory infection is Pneumocystis jirovecii, which is a common opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals and is more commonly seen in individuals with a history of smoking. Pneumocystis jirovecii is not known to form endospores, does not have a cell wall, and is not transmitted by air conditioning. However, it is more commonly seen in individuals who have had close contact with parrots, which is why option C is the correct answer.",C,False

###Question: A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started “intermittent fasting” to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract
B.  Chronic viral infection of the liver
C.  Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
D.  Defective bilirubin excretion

###Answer:","D. Defective bilirubin excretion.

The patient's symptoms of scleral icterus (yellowing of the eyes) suggest jaundice, which is a sign of defective bilirubin excretion. The patient's history of intermittent fasting, previous episode of jaundice after an appendectomy, and recent binge drinking are all potential causes of hepatocellular injury, which can lead to defective bilirubin excretion. However, the patient's unremarkable physical examination and denial of smoking make autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of the biliary tract (Option A) less likely. Chronic viral infection of the liver (Option B) is also less likely given the patient's lack of risk factors for viral hepatitis and normal physical examination. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Option C) is a possible cause of defective bilirubin excretion, but it is not the most likely explanation in this case given the patient's history of intermittent fasting and binge drinking, which are known to cause hepatocellular injury and impair bilirubin excretion. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is Defective bilirubin excretion (Option D).",D,False

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and urine microscopy findings are consistent with nephrolithiasis, or kidney stones, which can cause metabolic acidosis due to the loss of bicarbonate in the urine. Anion gap metabolic acidosis is a type of metabolic acidosis characterized by an increased anion gap, which is a measure of the difference between the sum of the concentrations of unmeasured anions and cations in the blood. Calcium oxalate crystals, as described in the question, are a common cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis due to kidney stones. Therefore, the answer is A.",A,True

###Options:
A.  Atenolol
B.  Labetolol
C.  Nifedipine

###Answer:","D. Phenoxybenzamine. This medication is used to block the effects of catecholamines, which can be released during surgery in patients with pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism. It is important to note that this medication should be started several days before surgery to allow adequate time for it to work. In this case, the patient has a history of hyperparathyroidism, which can also cause the release of catecholamines during surgery, making phenylephrine a reasonable choice. However, since the patient has already undergone a thyroidectomy, it is more likely that she has been diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism, which is a more common cause of adrenal masses in patients with a history of thyroidectomy. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Phenoxybenzamine.",D,True

Explanation:
The patient presents with clear vaginal discharge, positive nitrazine test, and uterine contractions, which are indicative of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). The most appropriate next step in management is to administer antibiotics (ampicillin) and perform amnioinfusion to reduce the risk of infection and prevent further preterm labor.

a0b9a1cd-4e4f-450b-b0bf-ba9af53af1d4,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?","Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons).

###Options:
A.  Distal peripheral microembolism
B.  Necrotizing fasciitis
C.  Protein S deficiency
D.  Waldenström macroglobulinemia

###Answer:","A. Distal peripheral microembolism.

This patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and imaging results are consistent with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The sudden onset dyspnea, tachycardia, tachypnea, and S3 gallop are indicative of right heart strain from a PE. The erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins suggest a recent DVT. The patient's history of smoking, diabetes, and family history of PE increase her risk for this condition. Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's condition is distal peripheral microembolism from a PE.

Option B, Necrotizing fasciitis, is a bacterial infection that causes tissue destruction. It is not related to this patient's condition.

Option C, Protein S deficiency, is a rare genetic condition that increases the risk for thrombosis. However, it is not mentioned in the patient's history, and there is no evidence to suggest this diagnosis.

Option D, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, is a type of lymphoma that causes the production of an abnormal protein called IgM. It is not related to this patient's condition.",A,False

###Options:
A.  Total hysterectomy
B.  Estrogen vaginal cream
C.  Reassurance and follow-up
D.  Progestin therapy

###Answer:","C. Reassurance and follow-up.

The patient's symptoms, menopausal status, and endometrial biopsy results are consistent with atrophic endometrium. The endometrial thickness of 6 mm is within the normal range for postmenopausal women. The patient's history of hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as her previous smoking history, may contribute to her vaginal atrophy. However, her symptoms and biopsy results do not indicate a significant risk for endometrial cancer. Therefore, reassurance and follow-up are the most appropriate next steps in management. If her symptoms persist or worsen, progestin therapy or estrogen vaginal cream may be considered. Total hysterectomy is not indicated based on the information provided.",C,False

D.  Mydriasis of the left eye

###Answer:","B. Miosis of the right eye only.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and exam findings are consistent with an optic neuritis, which is a common complication of SLE. Optic neuritis typically presents with unilateral vision loss, pain, and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), which is the absence of response in the affected eye when a light is shone in it. The unaffected eye, in this case the right eye, will have a normal response to a light, which is mydriasis or normal pupil size. Therefore, the answer is B. Miosis of the right eye only is not a correct answer as miosis is a contraction of the pupil.",B,False

###Question: A 51-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 3-week history of abnormal behavior. His wife reports he has been preoccupied with gambling at the local casino. He becomes restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and treatment was initiated. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase
B.  Direct activation of dopamine receptors
C.  Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B
D.  Inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase

###Answer:","A. Peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase.

Explanation: The most common drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease are levodopa and carbidopa. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, which is the neurotransmitter that is deficient in Parkinson's disease. Carbidopa inhibits the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, allowing more of the drug to reach the brain. Therefore, the answer is A.",A,False

###Options:
A.  ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2
B.  Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen
C.  Cleaving immunoglobulin A molecules
D.  Cleaving lecithin

###Answer:","D. Cleaving lecithin.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a Shigella infection, which is caused by Shigella bacteria. Shigella bacteria produce an enzyme called lipopolysaccharide O-antigen 2-acetyltransferase, which modifies the O-antigen of the bacterial cell wall, making it more difficult for the host's immune system to recognize and attack the bacteria. However, the question asks for the virulence factor that relies on a mechanism of action involving cleaving a specific molecule, and Shigella bacteria are known to produce an enzyme called invasin, which helps them invade the intestinal epithelium by cleaving the host cell membrane component lecithin. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,False
